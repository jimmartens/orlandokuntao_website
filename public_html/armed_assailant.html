              I was recently asked, "How do you handle a hidden knife (a knife in the assailant's other hand)?"
              Defending against an unseen knife is practically impossible.  This is true of any weapon, and
              assaults in general.  No one can defend against something unseen.  Since that is impossible,
              we must move to what is possible -- defending against weapons we can see (or believe our assailant
              possesses).  First, a general rule: <b><i>Rush a gun; RUN from a knife.</i></b>
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
              Within reasonable range and assuming you are not similarly <a href="martial_arts_and_ccw.html">armed</a>,
              you <i>rush a gun</i> simply because you have no chance of controlling it if you are within
              the range of the weapon, but outside arm's reach.  Since you cannot outrun a bullet, you might as
              well position yourself so you at least have a chance of controlling the weapon and possibly disarming
              your assailant.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
              On the other hand, you <i>run from a knife</i> because you want to stay as far out of your
              assailant's range as possible.  (Few can throw a knife accurately anyway and only a dummy would do
              that if he had only one.)  If flight is an option, and I&nbsp;can see or sense my opponent has a
              knife, I&nbsp;get the heck out of there.  Not very macho, but very smart self-defense.
              (Macho or senseless and foolish bravado gets more folks killed and injured than anything else in a fight.)

                  <i>For anyone who believes he can handle an assailant armed with a knife, please carefully
                    consider the following photos.  The photos are reportedly of a police officer trained
                    in hand-to-hand combat.  The officer believed that due to his size and fighting skill,
                    he could disarm a knife-wielding aggressor.

            <br>&nbsp;<br>
              If flight is not an option (i.e.  you must protect someone who cannot safely escape attack),
              then we close the gap quickly and, as with the gun, attempt to neutralize or disarm the assailant.
              As you might expect, since ours is a drill-focused school, we train the reflexes for both using and
              facing a knife via sombrada-range drills (see <a href="sombrada_knife.html">Knife&nbsp;Sombrada</a>
              and <a href="sombrada_hand.html">Hand&nbsp;Sombrada</a>).  Once the basic flow is internalized
              (quite easy since both drills actually have similar movements and lines), we then mix them by having
              one player wield the knife while his partner remains unarmed.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
              In this <i>mixed</i> mode, the unarmed defender must not only avoid, parry, or otherwise deflect
              the weapon, but he must also concentrate on attacking the limb that is wielding the weapon (see
              <a href="capturing_the_limb.html">Capturing&nbsp;The&nbsp;Limb</a>).  Essentially, this means
              setting aside your desire to strike your assailant in the face until after you've effectively
              neutralized his ability to even hold his weapon.  (Then you can pound the creep wherever
              you like <img src="images/face_smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face">)
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
              The basic drill pattern used in our sombrada-range knife, empty hand, and baton drills actually
              covers about 90% of the assault lines you're most likely to <i>see</i>.  When mixing them, the
              disadvantaged player makes limb destruction his primary focus.  Once his movements satisfy that,
              and to perpetuate the drill, the disadvantaged player then feeds his knife-wielding partner the
              counter punch or attack line he needs to continue the drill and train his reflexes as well.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
              Facing a weapon is terrifying, and if you are not afraid, you are either nuts or a fool.
              Still, these days weapons-based assaults are increasingly common and anyone who neglects this aspect
              of martial arts training is equally foolish.
