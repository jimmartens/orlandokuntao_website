            <br>A Colorado resident and computer professional since 1965, Bob&nbsp;Orlando was introduced to the martial arts while on active duty in the U.S.&nbsp;Marines.&nbsp; However, it was not until after he left the Corps that the flicker of interest that was kindled there became his consuming fire.
            <p>In 1968 Orlando began serious study in Chinese kenpo-karate<small><sup>&thinsp;<a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></small>.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter he switched to kung fu, studying under <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dacascoswhkd.com">Al&nbsp;Dacascos</a> (then teaching in Denver, Colorado).&nbsp; His training with Dacascos lasted nearly four years, until a back operation made it impossible to continue in Dacascos' high-kicking style of kung&nbsp;fu.&nbsp;
            <p>It was back to kenpo.&nbsp; There Bob received his first-degree black belt from Dr.&nbsp;John&nbsp;P. Cochran.&nbsp; Although Bob has subsequently earned additional rank in multiple arts, he prefers to say that he is a life-long student of the arts and leave it at that.&nbsp; &quot;Rank,&quot; he says, &quot;is excess baggage.&nbsp; It&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;hindrance to learning because everyone expects that you already know everything.&quot;
            <p>Ever a student of the arts, Bob's quest for knowledge has taken him into aikido, Small-Circle Jujitsu, grappling, iaido, and Filipino martial arts.&nbsp; However, the  period in his training which he calls&nbsp; <i>catalytic</i>&nbsp; was the time spent studying Chinese kuntao and Dutch-Indonesian pukulan pentjak silat under master <a href="willem_de_thouars.html">Willem de&nbsp;Thouars</a>.&nbsp; After a decade of training with de&nbsp;Thouars, Bob received his teaching certificate from him in 1994.
            <p>A graduate of a Jesuit university, Bob is the author of <i><a href="books_and_videos.html#iff_jump">Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</a>: The Brutal Arts of the Archipelago</i>,&nbsp; <i><a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump">Martial Arts America</a>: A Western Approach to Eastern Arts</i>,&nbsp; and four highly recommended martial art <a href="books_and_videos.html">videos</a>.&nbsp; While owner and operator of his own school, Bob still considers himself a &quot;full-time&quot; student of the arts.&nbsp; His school is a small one, and that's just the way he likes it.&nbsp; &quot;Our school is our laboratory.&nbsp; There, we test everything from the practicality of forms training and techniques, to the latest craze (or <i>crazies</i>) in self-defense.&nbsp; We have a formal curriculum &mdash; from white to black belt &mdash; although it is not cut in stone.&nbsp; I&nbsp;guess that for us, the concrete is never quite dry, for we (including myself) are constantly learning.&quot;
            <p>Of his own abilities, he says, &quot;I&nbsp;have skills.&nbsp; After almost 50 years in the arts, I&nbsp;should.&nbsp; My skills, however, came not because of any natural physical ability, but because I&nbsp;worked very hard with the God-given talent with which I was blest to get to where I&nbsp;am today.&nbsp; My strengths are my singleness of purpose, my unwavering dedication to personal excellence in self-defense, and my analytical mind.&nbsp; My contribution to the art comes not from what I&nbsp;can do physically.&nbsp; Rather, it comes from my ability to effectively share what I&nbsp;know with others.&nbsp; I&nbsp;take the complicated and make it simple.&nbsp; <i>I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="teacher.html" target="main_display_area">teacher</a></i>.&quot;
