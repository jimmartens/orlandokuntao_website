            <p><b>Bob Orlando Sets the Tone</b>
            <p>As to the form itself, <b>. . .</b> it serves the purpose.&nbsp; It's not outstanding, nor is
              it mediocre,
            <font color="blue">
              <i>but <b>. . .</b> the interpretation <b>. . .</b> is far and away some of the best demonstrations
              of pure Kuntao and Pencak Silat you will find on video today.</i>
            </font>&nbsp; Bob Orlando knows his stuff, and is willing to give it to you with no nonsense or
              mystical oogah-boogah.&nbsp; This point alone makes him stand out from the typical martial arts
              DVD crowd like a circus freak at a child's birthday party,
            <font color="blue">
              <i>but where he really shines is the rationale behind the moves.</i>&nbsp;
            </font>
              Bob interlaces his physical demonstrations with a technical lesson that's difficult to ignore.&nbsp;
              He points out various possibilities and directions you can take a move, and intelligent discourse
              behind his reasoning for doing it the way he does.&nbsp; It's the kind of DVD you continue thinking
              about for hours after you turn off the TV. <small>[emphasis added]</small>

              </b>
            <p>There are hundreds of videos on Silat and Kuntao out there, with more coming out every month.&nbsp;
              It's easy to spend a lot of money on something that wasn't worth the box it came in.&nbsp; However, if
              you are looking for some serious insight into the Indonesian martial arts, Bob&nbsp;Orlando's
              "<i>Fighting Footwork of Kuntao and Silat</i>" and "<i>Fighting Forms of Kuntao-Silat</i>" are the
              perfect place to start.

            <br>Rating: 10
            <p>The world of martial arts has changed dramatically over the past 20 years.&nbsp; Decades ago,
              forms training were the main way students practiced their art.&nbsp; This practice has fallen
              by the wayside since many money martial arts disapprove of the method.&nbsp; Those that are
              fortunate enough to view a copy of Bob&nbsp;Orlando &mdash; The Fighting Forms of Kuntao Silat
              may walk away from the experience with a renewed interest in forms training.
            <p>Kuntao Silat is a traditional self-defense art of Malaysia and Indonesia.&nbsp; Bob&nbsp;Orlando
              is a USA based martial artist and Kuntao Silat expert that has released a number of excellent
              videos on the subject.&nbsp; With this "Fighting Forms" video, he demonstrates a rather lengthy
              form and then breaks it down into its practical application components.&nbsp; Far too many DVDs
              that deal with classical forms training only cover the movements as seen in the forms.&nbsp;
              On Orlando's DVD, we are shown the meanings behind the forms as well as self-defense applications.&nbsp;
              These self-defense applications are simple, basic, practical, and easy to train.&nbsp; While that
              may not sound like a spectacular description of the material, it is a description of a straight
              forward methodology that is easy to become proficient with.&nbsp; And is that not what most martial
              artists would prefer?
            <p>Bob&nbsp;Orlando is also quite laid back and humorous and his lighthearted approach makes watching
              the DVD a lot of fun.&nbsp; For those looking to learn about the art of Kuntao Silat, this DVD is
              definitely worth the price of admission.<br>&nbsp;

            <p>Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is top notch and has a very practical approach to the djurus and their application
              which is a plus in the urban western setting.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have seen a lot of silat techniques that
              would not be suitable in the concrete northern jungle because of the terrain.&nbsp; But Mr.&nbsp;Orlando
              presents a very good package that would compliment any style or setting especially his lower limb
              destructions.&nbsp; Good video as always.

            <p><b>Another great DVD</b>
            <p>Up there with Remy Presas of Modern Arnis and Dr.&nbsp;Yang, Jwing-Ming of YMAA, who teaches
              Chin Na, Shaolin White Crane and Tai Chi, Bob&nbsp;Orlando's videos land in my favorite group
              as far as Martial Arts video training is concerned.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have seen many videos concerning
              many arts such as Kali/Escrima/Arnis, Silat, Hapkido, Krav Maga, Chin Na and Tai Chi Chuan and
              many others.&nbsp; There are few out there that can convey their art into video form with limited
              time.&nbsp; Bob&nbsp;Orlando's best asset is his ability to capture the art of Silat and teach it
              in a common sense form that's easily digestable.&nbsp; This is certainly a recommended DVD for
              the new Silat student.<br>&nbsp;

            <p><b>I LOVE THIS VIDEO SET!</b>
            <br>I own numerous forms videos, but these are absolutely two of my favorites!&nbsp;
              <i>The Fighting Forms of Kuntao-Silat</i>&nbsp; are very fluid, but incredibly practical.&nbsp;
              Not only does Mr.&nbsp;Orlando break the forms down from several angles to make
              them easier to learn, but he goes into great detail to share his knowledge on the
              applications, concepts, and principles within the forms.&nbsp; Then, as if that
              wasn't already enough, there is a surprise scene or two that are absolutely hilarious.&nbsp;
              I&nbsp;won't ruin it for you, but you would just have to see those scenes to appreciate them.
            <p>Obviously, for those who have trained with Mr.&nbsp;Orlando in person, they get the best
              of both worlds. Hands-on training with Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is absolutely the way to go and
              the videos are great as an addition to their training and for reference.&nbsp; However,
              if you have not been able to train with Mr.&nbsp;Orlando in person, this is definitely the
              next best choice.&nbsp; These videos are worth their weight in gold.<br>&nbsp;

            <p>In his latest double DVD "The Fighting Forms of Kuntao-Silat", Bob Orlando creatively examines
              two of the major forms of his school.&nbsp; What is there here for those of us who don't practice
              these forms or train in his school?&nbsp; A lot.
            <br> <b>. . .</b>
            <br>Whereas previous videos have dealt with various details such as general fighting principles,
              leg patterns (langkahs) and hand forms (jurus), the purpose of this video is to draw everything
              together into a coherent whole.&nbsp; The Forms of Kuntao-Silat develop whole body connection,
              integration and fighting application.
            <br> <b>. . .</b>
            <br><i>Bob is prepared to examine and evaluate the movements he has been given, keeping them alive
              and thriving, rather than just handing on cultural relics without a thorough and critical
              investigation.&nbsp; He has done what we believe every martial artist should do -- he has made
              the forms his own.&nbsp; Because he understands them, he owns them and because he owns them,
              he is able to pass them on to us.</i><small> [emphasis added]</small>

            <p><b>The DVDs are GREAT!</b>
            <p>The DVDs are GREAT!&nbsp; GREAT material, fantastic breakdown and explanations, excellent
              production.&nbsp; Absolutely the best material I have ever seen on any MA!&nbsp; And I really
              like the workbook.
            <p>Both forms are great.&nbsp; I have watched the video this weekend four times and with each
              viewing I see something new.&nbsp; I can honestly say that everything I have learned so far
              in our style of silat is clearly present in your forms:&nbsp; Djurus, Langkah, Garisan, Gayongs
              and the Sambuts.&nbsp; Putar Kepala, Kenjit, Angkat, Beset--they are all there.&nbsp; What is
              important to me is how they have opened my eyes to whole new dimensions in our system's
              techniques.&nbsp; I especially like your breakdown on the Putar Kepala family.
            <p>Yesterday I have started to learn the Elbow Exercise, just to get the feeling.&nbsp; I practiced
              the salutation for almost an hour and I really enjoy it.&nbsp; Thank you so much.<br>&nbsp;

            <br>February 16, 2009
            <p>Bob, I must say that I fully disagree with you, you are very good at your forms.&nbsp; People
              must realize that there is no one way of teaching these arts.&nbsp; Just because one teaches Jurus
              and the other teaching forms doesn't mean one of these teachers are wrong.&nbsp; This just means
              they teach their art differently.
            <p>You make some very good points in this DVD series.&nbsp; I like the point you made about relaxing
              and not keeping your body stiff.&nbsp; One great point you made is that most street hoods don't get
              into a right lead.&nbsp; They get in a left lead and the importance of practicing against the left lead.
            <p>Your forms will give the Kuntao/Silat practitioner a very good understanding of blocking, striking,
              and evasion and the forms possible combat application.&nbsp; As you have always said, what is in your
              DVD is only a few of many different applications of these forms.&nbsp; I feel by stressing this gives
              the person buying your DVD an endless amount of discovery and techniques to practice.&nbsp; I found
              that this DVD and booklet series will help people of many systems have a better understanding of combat.
            <p>Well done Bob, you're a great teacher and I really enjoy your DVDs.

            <p>No one has ever accused me of being the forms or kata queen and there is good reason for that,
              because I'm not.&nbsp; I have never particularly liked doing forms and I'm also not particularly
              good at them because I am fundamentally a fighter.&nbsp; So when I look at forms, I examine them
              for practical techniques and movement that I can use in a real fight.&nbsp; I also look for forms
              that are esthetically pleasing to watch.<p>Bob Orlando's kuntao-silat form, Enam Matjan, is beautiful
            <i>and</i> combat applicable <font size="-1">[emphasis added]</font>.&nbsp; <i>Enam Matjan</i> means
              "Tiger Six" in English.&nbsp; Bob approaches the form with his usual precision and elegance.&nbsp;
              The form is performed several times in its entirety, then broken down into several short series,
              and then combat applications are demonstrated for each series.&nbsp; This two-DVD set is fun and
              there's plenty of extra information throughout.
            <p>This is Bob's best DVD to date.&nbsp; He is relaxed and practiced, and his Bob-isms add flavor
              throughout.&nbsp; The Paladin Press first-rate editors have done an excellent job showing techniques
              and movement from several camera angles so there is no question what each technique looks like.&nbsp;
              Everything about this 3-hour DVD set is well done and has some really great extras included.&nbsp;
              The first is a lovely, practical little elbow exercise created by George Morin and broken down by
              Bob for your combat pleasure.&nbsp; The second and third extras are Enam Matjan and the elbow
              exercise demonstrated with Bob's amazing <a href="fforms_workbook.html">stick&nbsp;figures</a>
              included in a workbook!&nbsp; You have to see these stick guys to believe what a great addition
              they are!&nbsp; I won't tell you what the fourth extra is, but watch the DVDs all the way to the
              end, it's worth it.
