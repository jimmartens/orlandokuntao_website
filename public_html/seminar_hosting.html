            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Fees</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>Seminar fees are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>In Colorado, $250 plus expenses for a one-day workshop.</li>
              <li>Elsewhere within the United States and Canada, $500 plus expenses for a weekend seminar</li>
              <li>Outside the United States and Canada, $750 plus expenses (a $500 deposit in the form of
                a cashier's check or money order is required for all overseas events &mdash; all others pay cash
                unless we've worked with the host in the past).</li>
            </ul>
            Participant fee is determined by the seminar host.&nbsp; (As all monies paid to Bob Orlando
            are declared as income, we gladly provide receipts, but for new hosts, final payment must be
            made in cash.)

            &nbsp;<p>
            <font face="Verdana"><big><b>Scheduling</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>Most of our workshops are weekend events.&nbsp; For weekend seminars arrival is usually
            Thursday or Friday, with return home on Sunday evening.&nbsp; (For international events arrival
            is usually a day or two earlier with the return trip home a day or so after the event.)&nbsp;
            Friday is open to whatever the host wishes to do: play privately, share with some of the host's
            friends and students, whatever.&nbsp; Saturday and Sunday seminar instruction comes to around 10
            hours of actual instruction.&nbsp; We prefer leaving in time to arrive in Denver (DIA) no later
            than 10:00 PM.

            &nbsp;<p>
            <font face="Verdana"><big><b>Video Taping</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>A video camera is brought and the event recorded.&nbsp; A high quality copy for the host
            (and him only) is provided and usually within a week.&nbsp; No other recording of the workshop is permitted.

            &nbsp;<p>
            <font face="Verdana"><big><b>Workshop Materials</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br><a href="sample_seminar_handout.html">Handouts</a> of the material presented are provided for
            the participants.&nbsp;  We recommend the host limit these to prepaid participants as a means of
            encouraging pre-registration.

            &nbsp;<p>
            <font face="Verdana"><big><b>Event Promotion</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>If the host is setting up an&nbsp; <i>open</i>&nbsp; event, we will gladly list the upcoming workshop
            on our web site, as well as on a couple of martial arts bulletin boards (those desiring semi-private
            seminars often pass on this service).&nbsp; Obviously, contact information for that is needed.&nbsp;
            If space is limited, we will say so in all listings and request inquirers to RSVP the host.

            &nbsp;<p>
            <font face="Verdana"><big><b>Additional Requirements</b></big></font>
            <ul compact>
              <li><b>All participants (male and female) must wear groin protection</b>
                <br>Male groin protection means a good <a href="required_equip.html">hard&nbsp;cup</a>
                (you would not believe how many think a soft cup will work &mdash; heck, I didn't
                even know they made such a thing for guys).&nbsp;
                <a href="required_equip.html#female">Good groin protection</a> is also available for the ladies.&nbsp;
                Not only is groin protection a sound training practice, in a highly litigious society like ours,
                it is sound risk management.&nbsp; (You can read all the reasons why we require this of the ladies
                as well in my book, <a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump"><i>Martial Arts America</i></a>.)<sub>&nbsp;</sub>
                <br>
                <p>
              </li>

              <li><b>Female participants must also wear breast protection</b> &ndash; a
                <a href="required_equip.html#breast_protection">sports&nbsp;bra</a> with protective
                inserts is fine.&nbsp; (Check out <a href="http://www.orlandokuntao.com/MAA_9_yin_connection.html">The Yin Connection: Women &amp; the Martial Arts</a>
                to get an idea as to why breast protection is so important to the success of their training.)
                <p>Because we want to provide the best possible instruction at workshops, we are sticklers
                when it comes to groin and breast protection (breast protection is also available at
                <i>Century Martial Art Supply</i> and from <i>Ringside</i>) and even though it costs us an
                occassional seminar, we make NO exceptions.&nbsp; Scheduling a seminar far enough in advance
                allows sufficient time for all participants to get the required equipment before the event.
                <p>
              </li>

              <li><b>No children participants</b><sub>&nbsp;</sub><br>What we do is not for kids.&nbsp;
                If someone has a big 16 year-old who acts his size and not his age, and providing his
                parent signs the necessary release, then he may participate &mdash; we leave the final
                decision for that up to the host.
                <p>
              </li>

              <li><b>If a participant has a cold, he cannot play.</b><sub>&nbsp;</sub>
                <br>He may observe (something we strongly recommend &mdash; you can read our thoughts on the
                power of observation in training in our book,
                <a href="books_and_videos.html#iff_jump"><i>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</i></a>).&nbsp;
                If he does not wish to observe (and receive any handouts), then he is to receive a full refund.&nbsp;
                It should be obvious why we do this &mdash; no one wants to catch a cold or the flu.&nbsp;
              </li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;<p>
            <font face="Verdana"><big><b>Satisfaction Guarantee</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>We guarantee the seminar.&nbsp; If the host is not satisfied, he does not pay &mdash; simple as that.&nbsp;
            No hard feelings.&nbsp; Obviously we won't return, but since the host paid for the airline ticket, hotel
            room, meals and expenses; he shouldn't have to pay the fee for what was for him a disappointing workshop.&nbsp;
            All we require is a letter stating fully why he was dissatisfied.&nbsp; But we are sure you <i>will</i>
            be satisfied.&nbsp; (Read the <a href="testimonials.html">testimonials</a> of previous seminar and workshop
            hosts, and feel free to contact them.)
            <p>Finally, we will gladly answer any questions you might have regarding hosting a seminar.&nbsp;
            Rest assured that such an inquiry in no way constitutes a comittment.&nbsp; There are many reasons why
            an event doesn't automatically follow an honest inquiry.&nbsp; Some folks object to these requirements,
            others have things happen in their lives that make scheduling an event impossible.&nbsp; We understand
            and respect this.&nbsp; For that reason, we bug no one following an inquiry and remain open to future
            collaboration.
