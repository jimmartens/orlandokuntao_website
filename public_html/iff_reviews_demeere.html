            <p><b>Review by <a href="http://www.WimDemeere.com" target="blank_">Wim&nbsp;Demeere</a></b><br>June 7, 2001.
            <p>Here's another old review: Indonesian fighting fundamentals: The brutal arts of the archipelago by Bob Orlando.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cleaned it up a bit and added some extra information.&nbsp;Enjoy!
            <p>Bob Orlando is a martial arts teacher and writer perhaps best known for his knowledge of Penchak Silat and Kuntao.&nbsp; In this book, he explains the fundamental principles that form the backbone of these two arts.&nbsp; As these are also covered in the video Fighting Arts of Indonesia, I will not go into great detail about them here but will do so in another review.&nbsp; I'd rather tell you some more about the material that isn't covered in the video.
            <p>The book starts with a foreword and preface, including some acknowledgments.&nbsp;There is also a note to the reader, giving information on the demonstrated techniques, clothing and spelling used.&nbsp; In the introduction, Bob defines some terms, explains how the book came about and stresses the value of concepts and principles.
            <p>The chapter "From osmosis to order" explains how the basic learning process works and shows some methods of entry for further reference: block left and right, strike left and right.
            <p>The following chapters deal with the fundamental principles of the art: Adhesion, whiplash, gyroscopic rotation,shearing, seating, leg maneuvers and "peanut brittle".&nbsp; Suffice it to say that these principles are very sound and work as they claim to.&nbsp; The reason why is that they can be backed up by science.&nbsp; Action-reaction, friction, inertia and gravity are all things we have pretty much accepted.&nbsp; They work.&nbsp; And so do the principles Mr.&nbsp;Orlando describes.
            <p>Now comes a chapter about Kuntao.&nbsp; This art is a result of fighting methods, as practiced by the Chinese immigrants living in Indonesia and Malaysia.&nbsp; They were confronted with fierce warriors and altered their arts to respond to the local fighting methods.&nbsp; The result is a particularly aggressive art.&nbsp; Bob discusses it's history and future while showing how it differs from Silat.
            <p>Next is "Jurus".&nbsp; You can compare these to kata or forms found in other arts.&nbsp; A couple of sequences are shown, followed by (a few of the) applications derived from them.&nbsp; The idea is not to show a full Juru, but to give you a better understanding of their beauty and martial value.
            <p>Silat vs Kuntao is an explanation of the unique style called Mustika Kweetang Silat, presented by Mr.&nbsp;Jim Ingram.&nbsp; This martial art was developed from both Silat and Kuntao and is therefor a rather interesting one.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Ingram demonstrates techniques that allow you to distinguish between the different sources.
            <p>The next chapter talks about magic and mysticism.&nbsp; This is a side of Silat that few people are willing or able to explain in clear terms.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando writes about the influence major religions had on the Indonesian culture.&nbsp; He also mentions the use of magic and inner force that is often claimed by practitioners, but rarely proven.
            <p>Next is a more ethical discussion: When you teach such destructive arts, some level of ethical conscience is necessary.&nbsp; There are personal and social issues you have to take into account and Bob makes some very good points concerning this.
            <p>The chapter about "Kun Lun Pai" is a bit problematic to cover.&nbsp; The subtitle is "The heart and soul of Willem de Thouars", which I feel is the best description.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cannot synthesize this chapter without leaving out important aspects.&nbsp; It is best read as a whole so read the book and find out.
            <p>There is a short epilogue and biography of the author in closing.
            <p><b>Interest:</b> <font color="blue">This book is an excellent example of what authors should more often do: Instead of just rehashing the same material, Bob gives you information on several topics that aren't included in the video.&nbsp; As a result, both the book and video are excellent companions for each other.&nbsp; You can read the book and then see the principles come to life in the video.&nbsp; However, once you've seen all this, there is even more to ponder when reading.</font>&nbsp; The best description is "added value".&nbsp; Too often, I review products that say the same thing several times but in a different package.
            <p>This book is not one of those.&nbsp; There is a wealth of information in it, that isn't limited to Silat or Kuntao practitioners.&nbsp; If you do happen to study these arts, you will be even more happy to get a copy.&nbsp; Another "must have" item for your wishlist.
            <p>One word of warning: The book isn't about specific techniques.&nbsp; It's not a "how to" guide.&nbsp; The purpose is to show why techniques work, not how many different ones there are.
            <p>Another point is that the book was published in 1996 and the martial arts world was different then.&nbsp; Nowadays, every other teacher talks about "principles" but back then it wasn't the case.&nbsp; In that regard, Mr.&nbsp;Orlando was one of the pioneers of this approach and many teachers owe a debt of gratitude to him.&nbsp; It also means that today, you might be less impressed by his book.&nbsp; Simply because you've been exposed to this way of teaching from the get go.
            <p>That said, the information in this book is still as worthwhile now as when it was first published.&nbsp; So don't hesitate to get it, it's real good.
            <p><b>Quality:</b> The format of the book is very large which makes for pros and cons.&nbsp; It offers a clear lay out and the pictures are very big and of great quality.&nbsp; You don't have to page all the time to see a sequence completely.&nbsp; However, you definitely won't carry it in your pocket.
