            <p><b>A Great Book for MA Students and Teachers.</b>
            <br>
            <font color="blue">
              If you are thinking of studying MA or are studying <i>any</i> martial art or you have a son/daughter enrolled in a MA school you owe it to yourself to read this book.&nbsp;
            </font>
            It will bring to light many questions many people think but are afraid to ask.&nbsp; For example, anyone who has studied a &quot;mainstream&quot; martial art such as <i>Tae Kwon Do</i> (by far the most popular &quot;style&quot; in the US) may wonder at why the methods, techniques, and movements are so dissimilar to &quot;real&quot; fighting most people are exposed to e.g. boxing.&nbsp; Bob Orlando examines this question and many others often drawing into account historical and cultural context as to the reasons why MA is taught in particular ways.&nbsp; More importantly, once you understand this he helps you think about these issues in terms of your objectives in studying MA.&nbsp; If you are a parent of child involved in MA I think this is a must read to make sure you understand what you are really paying for.&nbsp; Suppose you hired a piano tutor, and your son/daughter practiced scales and had good &quot;technique&quot; but when it came to playing for real couldn't really play anything of substance.&nbsp; Similarly, if you enroll your child in MA be sure that it can pass the realism test if this is one of your goals (many people implicitly assume this because they see demos of students breaking wooden boards).&nbsp; This book explains how.
