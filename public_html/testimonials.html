            <p>Dear Bob Orlando,
            <p>All of the ladies that attended and the ministerial staff of JDF want to extend our sincerest thanks and appreciation
              for your kindness and generosity in providing the Self-Defense class on March 3, 2013.
              &nbsp;<small>[This is a free women's self-defense class we provide, scheduling by appointment only.]</small>
            <p>I have heard several stories from different ladies demonstrating your care in providing a safe and thoroughly
              interesting class.  You not only took good care of the ladies but in addition went overtime in the class without
              saying a word.
            <p>I believe you really demonstrated how a Christian gentleman can and should present himself and we are deeply grateful.
              We all want to express our deep appreciation.  Thank you so much!
            <p>Sincerely Yours,
            <p>Rev. Charles T. Martin<br>Administrative Pastor<br>Jubilee Deaf Fellowship<br>&nbsp;

            <p><b>From:</b> &nbsp; Pascal Masse,&nbsp; Tokyo, Japan
            <p>I&nbsp;trained with Bob Orlando in his school in Lakewood for two weeks and I&nbsp;can wholeheartedly say
              it was a rare privilege.&nbsp; Before going there, I&nbsp;had seen Bob's videos and I&nbsp;had read one of
              his books but, despite their many qualities, they still pale compared to the experience of training
              personally with the man himself.&nbsp; Bob has impressed me not only with his formidable fighting skills,
              derived from his long practice of Kuntao-Silat, but also with his sincerely humble attitude and his
              unwavering focus on what is practical today for self-defence.&nbsp; Refusing any grand tittle (No
              sifu/sensei/master for this man!) and being humorously informal almost all the time, Bob sees himself
              as a teacher first and foremost, one who "puts skills in your hands" to face today's challenges through
              evolving teaching tools such as drills, techniques and forms.&nbsp; Indeed, "I&nbsp;put skills in my students'
              hands" seems to be one of Bob's favorite sentence and it is one that will stay with me for a long time.
            <p>What Bob teaches/does in his school is definitely not flashy, not in fashion nowadays and not for everyone
              due to the sheer efficiency/self defense focus of the style but it works very well (having been on the
              receiving end a few times, I&nbsp;should know), it is well fitted to our times and is, therefore, immensely
              practical.&nbsp; Simply put, if you are really interested in self-defence, regardless of whether you are a
              martial artist or not, you NEED to train with Bob, either in Lakewood or through one of his seminars.&nbsp;
              No matter how good you are, You WILL learn something of value, either directly through learning Bob's style
              or through your interaction with him as his teaching skills and his insights will make you think and understand
              your own art further.&nbsp; It was a great gift to be able to train with Bob and I&nbsp;sincerely hope to be
              able to have this experience again in the future.

            <p>I&nbsp;chose this school mainly for its emphasis on practical training.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am pursuing a career
              in law enforcement and want to learn the most effective ways to keep myself and others safe from harm

            <br><b>Kuntao-Silat Seminar</b><p><b>Cold War Scout</b><br>Senior Member<br>May 23, 2005 13:00
            <p>Went to NJ for a kuntao-silat seminar this weekend put on by Bob Orlando.&nbsp; He is a well known
              Paladin Press videos/books guy.<p>First of all, what a great guy Bob Orlando is.&nbsp;
              Extremely personable.&nbsp; Quite wise.&nbsp; Very combatives knowledgeable.&nbsp; He eagerly helped
              peel the mysticism onion of Indonesian martial arts.<p>The material at the seminar itself was well
              worth the trip to NJ.&nbsp; Learning how to integrate legs (not just kicks) better into the close
              quarters fighting equation is a definite combatives plus.&nbsp; We did numerous, intensive practical
              exercises in each of his five fundamentals of Indonesian fighting arts:&nbsp; adhesion, whiplash,
              gyroscopic rotation, shearing, and seating.&nbsp; I&nbsp;found some of the techniques to be very
              efficient and subtly powerful.&nbsp; Being able to subtly put a hurting on somebody in front of a
              crowd of witnesses can be a wonderful tool to have in the tool kit during these trying times
              ("I&nbsp;only saw the officer slap the suspect.").<p>Bob Orlando is a great guy to train with
              for a weekend if you ever get the chance.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will probably make this annual pilgrimage.
            <p>BTW:&nbsp; the seminar was held at the Red Dragon Martial Arts Academy in Manville, NJ.&nbsp;
              Great group of guys doing their combatives thing in there.&nbsp; If you were looking for a place
              to practice martial arts in this area of NJ, this would be a great place to check out.&nbsp; The owner,
              Bob Teodorczy, is a real good, very competent, down to earth guy with no attitude whatsoever.
              All the students from the dojo who were at the academy were similarly genuine guys.&nbsp; Because of his
              day in, day out LEO background, as is the case with many of his students, the stuff taught there has a
              decidedly reality based flavor to it.&nbsp; If I&nbsp;lived up that way, I&nbsp;would have found a
              home in that dojo.<p><b>Cold War Scout</b>&nbsp; [Follow-up post]

            <p>I&nbsp;was somewhat surprised by how hard he hits, although his movements/strikes appeared rather
              effortless.&nbsp; He really demonstrated to me in a way I&nbsp;have not quite seen before, how
              important it is not to tense up but rather to be relaxed, loose and fluid.<br>&nbsp;

            <b>From:</b> &nbsp; Charles E. Dulin
            <br><b>Subject:</b> New Jersey Seminar
            <br><b>Date:</b>&nbsp; Mon, 9 Jun 2005 14:44:47 CST
            <p>I&nbsp;had the opportunity to train with Mr. Orlando on May 21-22.&nbsp; The seminar focused on several
              key concepts presented in Mr.&nbsp;Orlando's book and companion video on the fighting arts of
              Indonesia (highly recommended by the way).&nbsp; Information flowed at a steady, but manageable,
              rate with breaks after each block specifically for note-taking.&nbsp; In addition, participants
              received handouts on each technique or concept to enhance retention of the material.&nbsp; The
              Indonesian arts can be shrouded in mysticism, but the weekend's training was designed to clear
              any such concerns away.&nbsp; The focus was squarely on the physics and biomechanics of the
              movements, and the instructor plays by the "If I&nbsp;hit you you get to hit me" rule--that was a
              pleasant surprise.
            <p>A weekend with Bob Orlando is well spent regardless of one's martial background; he teaches
              movement principles that will dovetail with any art.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am primarily a Filipino stylist, but
              I&nbsp;found that in exploring, however briefly, another system my understanding of my own was greatly enhanced.

            <p>Recently I&nbsp;had the opportunity to host a Bob Orlando seminar on Pentjak Silat and Kuntao.&nbsp;
              This really was a fantastic experience for both myself and the seminar participants.&nbsp;
              Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is dynamic, innovative, and inspiring in everything he does.&nbsp; The seminar
              covered material from his book and companion video Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals, two of the
              best learning tools on Indonesian Martial Arts that you will ever find.&nbsp; The best thing
              about the way Mr.&nbsp;Orlando teaches is that everyone at the seminar came away with a clear
              understanding of the material and the theories behind the techniques.&nbsp; I&nbsp;heard more than
              once that this was the best seminar that someone had ever been to.  All of those statements
              came from people with many years of training and who had attended plenty of seminars!&nbsp;
              If you ever have the chance to train with Bob Orlando, I&nbsp;would highly recommend it.&nbsp; As a
              matter of fact I&nbsp;can't wait to have him out again for another one!

            <p>I&nbsp;wanted to thank you for the great insight into the Indonesian arts you shared in Topeka.&nbsp;
              I&nbsp;was very satisfied with the training I&nbsp;received.&nbsp; I&nbsp;shared some of the techniques with my
              small group in Missouri.&nbsp; They were excited to see the applications.&nbsp; I&nbsp;used to train
              under an instructor that worked with Eddie Jafri.&nbsp; Though my former instructor never shared
              the Pentjak Silat with us, he did use it on us during our training.&nbsp; Things were starting to
              click with what you showed us on Saturday.&nbsp; That is always a great feeling when you can finally
              say "Oh yeah, that IS how it is done".&nbsp; I&nbsp;also enjoy being able to share that with my students
              when they finally see the application.&nbsp; <b>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</b> I&nbsp;hope to be able to train
              with you again soon.&nbsp; This experience reignited my passion for broadening the scope of my training.

            <p>Last weekend was a great experience training with Bob Orlando at our school.&nbsp; He is a first class
              person and his knowledge, skill level and presentation of Pentjak Silat and Chinese Kuntao can only be
              compared to another great instructor.&nbsp; And that is Dan Inosanto.&nbsp; And comparing it, I&nbsp;mean
              there was no visible difference in the skill level and knowledge between them in these arts.&nbsp;
              And myself and my students have attended many Inosanto Seminars.&nbsp; At the end of both days we were
              comparing who had the most bruises on our bodies.&nbsp; A Bob Orlando seminar is a working seminar
              where he believes in practicing exact lines of entries and hitting targets that you are aiming at.&nbsp;
              In other words, "<i>You don't practice to miss</i>" as Bob would say [emphasis added].&nbsp; Needless
              to say we know why its MANDATORY to wear groin protection..LOL..&nbsp; Everyone enjoyed themselves and
              gained a lot of information while having a lot of fun.&nbsp; Most of the attendees at the seminar were
              instructors from other schools along with my assistant instructors and students.&nbsp; The best
              testimonial that I&nbsp;could receive from them was simply that they wanted me to bring Bob Orlando back to
              the school as soon as possible for another workshop/seminar.&nbsp; I&nbsp;agree 100% with them and am looking
              forward to having the honor to bring him back so that he can share more of his endless knowledge in
              Pentjak Silat and Chinese Kuntao.

            <b>From:</b> &nbsp; Erskine Issac<br><b>Subject:</b> New Jersey Seminar
            <br><b>Date:</b>&nbsp; 2004-10-03 20:38:48 EDT<p>On September 25-26th, I&nbsp;was a participant in Bob Orlando's
              Kuntao-Silat seminar, held at the Red&nbsp;Dragon Martial Arts Academy in Manville, NJ.&nbsp; After reading his
              books and viewing his videos (which in my opinion are among the best in the business) I&nbsp;was curious to see
              how Mr.&nbsp;Orlando came across at arm's reach.&nbsp; And boy, my arms did sting at the hands of Bob Orlando.&nbsp;
              I&nbsp;can say without hesitation that Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is the real deal.
            <p>Bob Orlando is a great instructor and communicator.&nbsp; As a Vee-Jitsu student I&nbsp;found his information
              to be innovative and grounded in sound martial science, and his application very practical indeed.&nbsp;
              The only problem that I&nbsp;had with Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is that he could not stop time in order for me to go
              over his vast treasure chest of information within the two day seminar.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I&nbsp;received a
              bargain as far as seminars go in the martial arts business (or put bluntly, I&nbsp;did not walk away feeling
              I&nbsp;was ripped off).&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando has given me a new respect for drill training and has broadened
              my horizons in my own art of Vee Arnis Jitsu.&nbsp; And that my friends, are what seminars are designed
              to do.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr.&nbsp;Orlando for job a well done.
            <p>PS. Please work on the time control thing.

            <br><b>Re: <i>Block-left</i></b>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <b><i>Block-right</i></b>
            <p>Not once, but several times over the course of the last year, I've experienced something interesting.
              The last time was two days ago: Whenever I'm attacked by surprise (I&nbsp;have weird friends...) <i>Block-left</i>
              and <i>Block-right</i> pop up.&nbsp; And not just against punches, they come out against kicks and during
              ground work too.&nbsp; And not only when an attack is launched but also if I&nbsp;want to clear an area before
              going in or preempt a limb from attacking me by accelerating it away from it's nearest target.&nbsp;
              If feels like they just get launched by themselves. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could fly to
              Denver to train more.

            <p>As I&nbsp;write this, my body aches from being slapped around and thrown to the floor countless times
              during the seminar.&nbsp; Though the impacts are controlled, they are still very real.&nbsp;
              Willem de&nbsp;Thouars used to say "They have to feel it," and his student, Bob Orlando, makes
              sure we all do.&nbsp; To his credit, he receives as well as he gives.&nbsp; He would start laughing
              and teasing when people held back and got hit just as hard as the rest of us.&nbsp; All too often,
              teachers just show a technique but don't play along with the rest of the students.&nbsp; However,
              this was not the case here.&nbsp; Every day, Bob would be correcting people and having them hit him
              to make them understand better what they needed to do.&nbsp; He was continuously going from person
              to person, making sure everybody got it right.&nbsp; At almost 58 years old, he has an energy and
              enthusiasm that I&nbsp;have yet to see matched by any other instructor.&nbsp; In short, it was a joy to
              learn from him.
            <p>Now the seminar is over, I&nbsp;feel grateful to have had this opportunity to learn from him.&nbsp;
              Bob Orlando is a gifted teacher and has impressive technical and physical skills.&nbsp; With over
              30 years of training, he also has a depth of knowledge and understanding which he uses to help you
              not only <b>do</b>, but even more importantly so, also <b>understand</b> what he teaches.&nbsp;
              If you have the opportunity to study with him or attend one of his seminars, I'd very much recommend
              you to grab the opportunity.&nbsp; You will not be disappointed.

            <br><b>Newsgroups:</b> &nbsp; rec.martial-arts.moderated
            <br><b>Date:</b> &nbsp; 2002-09-16 13:07:32 PST
            <p>We had the opportunity to train privately with Bob Orlando for three days in summer 2002 and it
              was a phenomenal, hands-on experience!
            <p>In summer of 2001, the Filipino Kali-Eskrima Academy of Chicago (founded by Maha Guro Nate Defensor;
              founder of Defensor Method of FMA-IMA) hosted Bob Orlando (founder of Je&nbsp;du-too School of Martial
              Arts; student of Willem de Thouars) in a 2 day seminar.&nbsp; Bob's seminar in Chicago paralleled his
              first book, "Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals," and its corresponding videotape.
            <p>This past summer 2002, a few of us visited Bob at his school in Denver, Colorado for follow-up
              training.&nbsp; Prior to that, we corresponded with Bob outlining our "wish list" of topics to
              cover.&nbsp; You can say that we came to Denver with an agenda and left fully satisfied with the
              training that took place.
            <p>We spent three days with Bob and covered the following items.
            <blockquote>
                Day 1: Juru Satu.&nbsp; The first form taught by Willem deThouars and its their combative
                applications.&nbsp; This form is actually a combination of multiple jurus linked together in a
                flowing sequence.&nbsp; Thus, it is longer than most traditional Indonesian jurus.&nbsp; The
                point is that all forms training is a cultural expression and vehicle that conveys the philosophies,
                beliefs, culture, and body structure and movements of that system.&nbsp; This allowed us to "soak in"
                these aspects as a primer for the remainder of our stay.
              <p>Day 2: A variety of high level concepts and corresponding drills.&nbsp; Primarily, this dealt with
                arm traps and destruction, the flip kick and back kick, and ankle traps and destruction.
              <p>Day 3: Kilap Hand Sets 1 through 10 as flow drills and combative applications.  These are hand flow
                drills with predetermined movements that Bob created to teach different techniques and attributes.&nbsp;
                When performed as a flow drill, they burn in muscle memory, timing, and reaction (similar to what is
                achieved in drills such as think hubad lubad, knife tapping, sumbrada, dan chi sao, bong lop chi sao,
                push hands, etc.)  When performed as combative application, it teaches options for entry, takedown, and control.
            </blockquote>
              Our training time in Denver was amazing!&nbsp; Not only is Bob knowledgeable and able to execute
              what he teaches consistently in a real time environment, but he is also a wonderful teacher.&nbsp;
              He is similar to our Guro: very open, honest, non-political, gracious, humble, lighthearted and fun.&nbsp;
              It is rare to find an instructor who doesn't hold back and believes that any sincere question deserves
              a sincere answer.
            <p>He is also constantly trying to find ways to teach better and maximize training time.&nbsp;
              For that reason, he had a senior student assist in teaching on Days 1 and 2, allowed us to train in his
              open classes, and asked us to preview his new videotape for release in October, "Fighting Drills for
              Fighting Skills," to gain our feedback.&nbsp; The Kilap Hand Sets we covered in Day 3 is a subset of
              this 2 tape set and is shot extremely well from multiple angles and with narration during the action.
            <p>In short, we had a great time and was graced by Bob's personality, ability, knowledge and teaching
              ability.&nbsp; We would recommend him to anyone at any level seeking to learn Indonesian Martial Arts.

            <p>This past weekend our Martial Arts school brought in Bob Orlando for a seminar (actually it is
              a workshop!)  This workshop was incredible.&nbsp; Bob's skills in Silat and Kuntao are amazing and
              even more impressive are the skills Bob has in teaching his art.&nbsp; Bob is passionate about
              teaching, and passes this on to all the participants.&nbsp; In a matter of minutes after picking
              him up at the airport we felt as though we had made a new friend and by the end of the weekend we
              had!&nbsp; Bob makes all of the participants feel at ease in the dojo with him.&nbsp; This workshop
              was a lot of fun and a lot of good hard work.&nbsp; Everyone sweats!&nbsp; (Including Bob!)&nbsp;
              There is no attitude with Bob like some other big name martial artists.&nbsp; As soon as Bob began
              the workshop the excitement started.&nbsp; He welcomes any and all questions and gives handouts
              for each topic covered at the workshop.&nbsp; This way you have something to look back on as a
              training aid.
            <p>If you are not familiar with Bob Orlando, I&nbsp;suggest looking into his books and videos and
              definitely consider him for a workshop in your area.&nbsp; You will get more than your moneys worth!
            <p>(Here is a hint.....Be the host!  You get to pick his brain all weekend long.!)

            <p>We recently had Mr.&nbsp;Bob Orlando give a weekend seminar at our school in Taunton ,MA.&nbsp;
              It was the best and most informative seminar I've ever attended.&nbsp; His skill and knowledge is
              immense and is only surpassed by his teaching ability.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando most definitely has
              a way with people ,he made us all feel quite comfortable and at ease as though he was a member of
              our family.&nbsp; He didn't give anyone that "holier than thou" attitude that you sometimes get
              with highly ranked martial artist.&nbsp; In fact rank was not even an issue.&nbsp; His entire
              agenda revolved around teaching and not on having his ego boosted.&nbsp; Any questions we had
              were answered clearly and concisely, and he stressed that he wished not to change or replace our
              philosophy with his own but to enhance it with his years of experience and hard work.&nbsp;
              Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is truly a great Martial artist.&nbsp; We all feel honored to have had the
              privilege to have trained with him and we are already planning our next workshop with him.&nbsp;
              Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is for lack of a better word "AMAZING" and aspiring martial artist could have no
              better role model than he.&nbsp; Should any of you get the chance to have him to your school
              I&nbsp;assure that it will be a great and enriching experience.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is a treasure and
              we can't thank him enough for sharing himself with us.
            <p>Respectfully,
