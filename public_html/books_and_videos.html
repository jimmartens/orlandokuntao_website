            <br>Bob Orlando's videos are marvelous.&nbsp; I think Bob is a great teacher, and he explains all the concepts excellently.&nbsp; There are some really nice touches of humor there, too.
            <p>I think that the aspects of training where Mr. Orlando excels are often missing from more formally taught, <i>purely</i> Chinese arts, which these days seem so focused on patterns and sequences, rather than on adaptable fighting principles.&nbsp; I really applaud the practicality and open-mindedness of "Bill's Backyard" approach, but for me it is also very useful to have Bob's systematic methodology to distill and explain its essence.

            <br>This 3-hour, 2-DVD video with its accompanying 46-page <a href="fforms_workbook.html">workbook</a> examines two of our favorite kuntao-silat forms, <a target="main_display_area" href="forms_training.html#enam_matjan">Enam Matjan</a> and <a target="main_display_area" href="forms_training.html#elbow_exercise">Elbow Exercise</a>, analyzing them in light of their self-defense capabilities.&nbsp; Much to the frustration of some of my teachers, my motto has always been to question everything in training, considering every move and technique in light of it's value for improving my self-defense skills.&nbsp; This video reflects precisely that attitude and purpose.&nbsp; Here is Paladin's description of the video.
            <blockquote>
              <p>This is not just another forms video.&nbsp; In fact, it's nothing like any form you've ever seen.&nbsp; Rather than showing you a dry collection of martial arts moves that have no basis in real-world combat, this video teaches hard-core fighting skills in a format that's easily learned, repeatable and practical.&nbsp; Drawn from the best elements of the Indonesian combat art of kuntao-silat, this video shows you the only two forms you'll ever need.
              <p>Combining the author's logical, detailed instruction with multiple camera angles and slow-motion photography, you will learn two of our most fundamental forms of kuntao-silat: Enam Matjan and Elbow Exercise.&nbsp; Both teach the important combat basics of angle, leverage and body positioning to win any fight, including dealing with multiple assailants or fighting from a disadvantaged position.&nbsp; In addition, we show strikes with both the open hand and the fist that will literally stun your opponent with pain and leave him open to devastating leg destructions to disrupt his base.<p>This is the forms video for people who don't like forms and is a must-have for any complete combat library.&nbsp; The video set includes a 46-page <a href="fforms_workbook.html">workbook</a> on Enam Matjan and Elbow Exercise.

            <br>One of the most distinctive aspects of the Indonesian martial arts is their amazingly destructive legwork.&nbsp; While a kuntao or silat practitioner's hands are busy parrying, trapping and striking, his legs are simultaneously applying their own tactics to trap, unbalance and destroy an opponent's lower body.&nbsp; The result is a coordinated, total-demolition approach to personal combat.&nbsp; After years of analyzing Indonesian legwork and organizing it into almost a martial science, we now we make this information available to you in this four volume video series.&nbsp;
            <p><b>Volume 1</b> (approximately 90 minutes) shares the critical elements of silat, kuntao and hybrid kuntao-silat legwork and teach you the mechanics of trapping and unbalancing an opponent with your legs.&nbsp; We then show you the first two langkahs (lower-body training drills) of our system and show you how to apply them with all three fighting styles.&nbsp;
            <p><b>Volume 2</b> (approximately 65 minutes) explores the mechanics of the third and fourth langkahs in our system and show you the subtleties of their silat, kuntao and kuntao-silat variations.&nbsp; In the process, you'll see the secrets of the true fighting function of silat's distinctive cross-legged or "twist" stance and how this seemingly vulnerable platform can be used as a powerful combative tool.&nbsp;
            <p><b>Volume 3</b> (approximately 75 minutes) builds on the foundation of skill established in the first two volumes, teaching you how to integrate critical skills from langkas 1-4 (what we call the <i>atomic</i> langkas) into the two <i>molecular</i> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jfllTGbJEo" target="_blank">langkas (5 and 6)</a> of our six langka suite.&nbsp; Not only is seamless flow from one langka to another the objective in this volume, but also how to relentlessly pursue your attacker in a coordinated barrage of upper- and lower-body techniques &ndash; a hallmark of kuntao-silat fighting arts.
            <p><b>Volume 4</b> (approximately 55 minutes) completes this comprehensive body of work on the combative footwork of kuntao and silat by revealing the secrets of unique leg-strengthening methods and brutally destructive low-line kicking tactics, taking you through muscle-burning exercises and drills (Shell Drill, Rocky Drill, and Three-star) to develop the strength and stamina necessary to employ kuntao-silat footwork.&nbsp; Through this, we explore the deeper meaning of kuntao-silat legwork by showing you how to adapt the traps, grinds and locks you learned in the first three volumes of the series into a knee-breaking, ankle-popping arsenal of low-line kicks.

            <p>In this two-DVD video production, long-time kuntao-silat practitioner Bob Orlando teaches how to use partner and solo training drills to develop real fighting skills.&nbsp; In his methodical, no-nonsense style, Orlando gives you nothing but "the good stuff" &ndash; simple, practical flow drills that are specifically designed to program true combative skills into your muscle memory.&nbsp; Orlando begins with simple "atomic" partner drills that teach critical defensive skills and the basics of combat movement.&nbsp; He then builds on this foundation, combining the elements into more complex and dynamic "molecular" drills.&nbsp; Focusing only on what works, these drills efficiently combine upper-art (hands, elbows and forearms) and lower-art (knees and feet) techniques into a total skill set that will develop your fighting abilities and reflexes faster than any other training method available.&nbsp; Approx. 160 minutes.

            <p><i>Martial Arts America: A Western Approach To Eastern Arts</i> is not a typical how-to guide, but a broad survey of martial arts traditions and their evolution to modern Western practice.&nbsp; Challenging the purpose and effectiveness of many martial arts activities and training methods used in the United States today, the book sets a deep inquiring tone.&nbsp; Topics covered include the evolutionary cycle of combat arts, preserving ancient arts, philosophy and practice, training forms (kata), art versus sport, and women in the martial arts.

            <p>The fighting arts of Indonesia are an eclectic mixture of pentjak silat and Chinese kuntao that arose out of necessity throughout a history of violent cultural clashes and oppressive foreign occupation.&nbsp; They are brutal, unrelenting, and designed not only to take the enemy out but to punish him every step of the way.&nbsp; In this book, Bob Orlando, a long-time student of Dutch-Indonesian master Willem de Thouars and an accomplished instructor in this own right, gets to the heart of what makes these arts so formidable. &nbsp;Orlando does not simply give the reader techniques. &nbsp;Instead, he places the movements in context, providing a deeper understanding of their self-defense applications by exploring the underlying principles that make them work.
