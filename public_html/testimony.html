              Some time back, a visitor to my web site e-mailed me saying that he was "very interested in
              hearing about [my] conversion and some of the key things that the Lord has taught [me] as a believer."
              I&nbsp;hadn't previously included my testimony on my site because I&nbsp;felt that our school logo (with
              the cross in the center and featured prominently throughout the site) coupled with the articles about Christian
              participation in Eastern martial arts made it clear that I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Christian.&nbsp; I&nbsp;still believe
              they do.&nbsp; However, the personal testimony of a fellow martial artist and brother in the faith,
              Danny&nbsp;Young, was such an encouragement when I&nbsp;read it on his web site that I&nbsp;felt
              sharing what <i>Christ</i> has done in my life (it is <i>NOT</i> about me, but Him) might likewise
              encourage others.&nbsp; In that hope alone, I&nbsp;share the following:

            <p>I&nbsp;was baptized on September 19, 1971.&nbsp; I&nbsp;say "baptized" because
              I&nbsp;was saved (accepting Christ as my Lord and Savior) the Thursday before.&nbsp; Prior to that
              I&nbsp;was what I&nbsp;often refer to as a "cardboard Catholic" (that is, a&nbsp;Catholic on paper only).&nbsp;
              Spiritually, I&nbsp;was best described as an agnostic.&nbsp; Oh, I&nbsp;acknowledged the fact that there
              might be a God out there, but I&nbsp;seriously doubted that He could really be known by any of us.
              <br>&nbsp;<a name="endnote_1_back"></a>
              <br>In the months preceding my salvation, I&nbsp;explored Eastern religion and one of its 20th-century
              incarnations, "New Age."&nbsp; Both thoroughly convinced me of a life after death; however, they offered
              no assurance that any hereafter would be in any way pleasant.&nbsp; If anything, both Buddhism and Hinduism
              offered many lifetimes of more suffering before reaching
              <i>Nirvana</i>.<small><sup>&nbsp;<a href="#endnote_1">1</a></sup></small>&nbsp; I&nbsp;was in deep
              despair and plagued with thoughts of suicide.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was miserable, and I&nbsp;saw only a gloomy
              future and no relief, even in death (which is most likely why I&nbsp;did not kill myself at that time).&nbsp;
              I&nbsp;knew what a wretched person I&nbsp;was and recognized that I&nbsp;was completely unequal to the
              task of personal reformation.&nbsp; It was then that I&nbsp;met Dick Puter.&nbsp; At that time Dick was
              working as a fitness counselor at European Health Spa.

            <p>Dick is a Christian.&nbsp; Worse, he was a Baptist (to a Catholic growing up in Georgia &ndash; even a
              cardboard Catholic &ndash; the most dreaded of all proselytizers was a Southern Baptist).&nbsp; Dick began
              witnessing to me, and, as you might imagine, my first question to him was, "You're not a Southern Baptist,
              now, are you?"&nbsp; He assured me that he was not.&nbsp; (He failed to mention that he was a "Bible-thumping,
              Devil-kicking, King James, INDEPENDENT Fundamental Baptist!"&nbsp;<img src="images/face_smiley.gif" align="bottom" alt="Smiley face">)&nbsp;
              Still, Dick somehow talked me into committing to attend services at Denver Baptist Temple for six weeks.

            <p>It just so happened that my work schedule prevented us (my family and I) from attending for the first three
              weeks.&nbsp; Little did I&nbsp;know that had I&nbsp;not shown up on the fourth Sunday, Dick would have met
              me at my door the following Sunday.&nbsp; Fortunately, the Lord knew that such an act on Dick's part would
              immediately turn me off, so on the fourth Sunday we were able to go.&nbsp; We sat in the very last row.
              I&nbsp;had never seen such a sight.&nbsp; There were people there waving handkerchiefs and shouting "Amen" and
              "Hallelujah" throughout the service.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was a bit overwhelmed to say the least.&nbsp; After that
              service Dick asked me what I&nbsp;thought.&nbsp; "Well," I&nbsp;said, "it's different."&nbsp; (Was that ever
              an understatement&thinsp;!)  However, as weird as those folks seemed, I&nbsp;had given my word, and I&nbsp;would
              "endure" five more Sundays.

            <p><a name="endnote_2_back"></a>During those first weeks, we were visited a couple of times by both Dick and
              the pastor, Al Lacy.&nbsp; My sweet wife accepted Christ as her Lord and Savior on the fourth Sunday (she was
              always smarter than I).&nbsp; She was also baptized the same day.&nbsp; As you might imagine, I&nbsp;had all
              kinds of deep theological questions for her like, "was the water
              cold?"&thinsp;<img src="images/face_smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face">&nbsp; To make a long story a bit shorter, on the Thursday
              before our fifth Sunday, while lying in bed on my right side, facing our west, paint-peeling wall, I&nbsp;asked
              Jesus to save me.&nbsp; Just to be sure, I&nbsp;asked Him again on Friday and Saturday nights as well.&nbsp;
              Wow!&nbsp; He did.&nbsp; He lifted my despair, gave me hope for the future, and turned my life completely
              around.&nbsp; I&nbsp;still had much to learn (still do), and I&nbsp;made some awful mistrakes in the process,
              but He is faithful and He continues to love me, even when I&nbsp;make myself downright unlovable.&nbsp; That
              is our conversion story.<small><sup>&nbsp;<a href="#endnote_2">2</a></sup></small>&nbsp; But what has God
              done for us since then?

            <p>God does not stop with our conversion.&nbsp; He is both the author and the finisher of our faith
              (Hebrews 12:2), and there is always much to learn.&nbsp; Of the numerous lessons learned in our walk with Him,
              the following are my mile markers.&nbsp;
              <img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="0" vspace="20" border="0"> <!-- for printing .pdf -->

              <br>First, I&nbsp;recognized early on that although I&nbsp;accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior,
              I&nbsp;did NOT love Him.&nbsp; Clearly Jesus had saved me, and for that I&nbsp;was forever in His debt,
              but I&nbsp;could not honestly say that I&nbsp;loved Him &ndash; but hey, we'd just met.&nbsp; Such recognition was not
              bad, and it did not affect me negatively.&nbsp; Instead, it motivated me to learn as much about Him as
              I&nbsp;could.&nbsp; My wife and I&nbsp;began reading the Bible.&nbsp; We started in John and worked our way
              through the New Testament.&nbsp; We then read the other Gospels, and finally went to Genesis.&nbsp; As we read
              through the books of the kings (Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles), I&nbsp;saw such awful apostasy.&nbsp; Judah
              and Israel's kings were constantly wavering between good and evil (very, very evil).&nbsp;

            <p>Reading this, however, was really good for me.&nbsp; (All scripture is given by God and is profitable &ndash;
              even the "bad" parts.)&nbsp; I&nbsp;finally came to King Manasseh, the worst of the lot, and read in 2nd
              Chronicles how he was taken prisoner by the Assyrians and was cast into prison (by some accounts, his captors
              put out his eyes as well).&nbsp; Then, in Chapter 33, from within the bowels of that dark Assyrian prison,
              Manasseh cried out to God for forgiveness.&nbsp; (He was not merely sorry because he had literally hit bottom,
              but because he was genuinely sorry for all the evil he had done.)&nbsp; Amazingly, when he repented, God
              instantly, lovingly, and unconditionally forgave him!&nbsp; It was then that I&nbsp;fell in love with God.&nbsp;
              Now, I&nbsp;could say that I&nbsp;knew enough about Him to know that I&nbsp;was not only indebted to Him,
              but I&nbsp;loved Him as well.&nbsp; (Never as much as He loves me, but with all the heart and soul that
              I&nbsp;can muster.)

              <br>The second great lesson came when I&nbsp;thought the Lord wanted me to give up my martial arts.&nbsp;
              Oh, how I&nbsp;struggled with that one.&nbsp; Frankly, I&nbsp;found myself incapable of giving it up.&nbsp;
              Finally, I&nbsp;told Him as much.&nbsp; I&nbsp;said, "Lord, I&nbsp;can no more give up my martial arts than
              I&nbsp;can cut off my arm.&nbsp; Still, I&nbsp;want to be wholly yours, so I&nbsp;give You permission to
              take that from my life, for I&nbsp;cannot."&nbsp; I&nbsp;learned two things about God from this experience.&nbsp;
              First, that <i>He did not have to break me to take something out of me</i> (or me out of anything &ndash; in
              this case, the martial arts); He could simply change my desire (something I&nbsp;gave Him permission to do).&nbsp;
              Second, it pleased Him to give me my "desire" and to leave me in the arts I&nbsp;so love (thank You, thank
              You, thank You).&nbsp; He simply wanted me to willingly surrender everything to Him, including my obsession
              with the martial arts.&nbsp; What a God!

            <br>The third great lesson came when I was doing pretty good in martial arts competition.&nbsp; I remember telling
              my Lord sometime before this, "Lord, if I&nbsp;go down any direction in this (martial arts), then feel free to
              break my leg if necessary to stop me."&nbsp; I believe I said that because I'd seen folks with broken legs before,
              and, frankly, they all seemed to do OK.&nbsp; Well, apparently I was heading in a direction that would likely draw me
              away from Him, because one day as I was racing my 15&nbsp;year-old son down a sidewalk by our apartment, my left
              leg experienced a spiral compound fracture of both the tibia and fibula.&nbsp; I did not slip, trip, or anything
              that would have brought me down.&nbsp; In my mind, God had my guardian angel stick out his foot and send me flying.&nbsp;
              When my leg snapped, I flipped forward 180&deg; landing with both hands on the ground behind me, with my right foot on
              the ground in front of me (all three holding me up) as my left leg was held up off the ground, dangling in the air.&nbsp;
            <p>
              Wow!&nbsp; What a lesson!&nbsp; God knew just what kind of break it would take to keep me from drifting away from Him.&nbsp;
              After almost a year in the cast, it took another year of training before I could actually strike a hanging bag with my left
              foot.&nbsp; What a lesson.&nbsp; Ask God to direct your life (and specifically by suggesting ways to do it that we think
              will not be too bad) and you will be surprised at His hand.&nbsp; When all that happened, I knew He caused all this in
              answer to my prayer.&nbsp; The fact that God loves me enough to even interact in my life at this level is absolutely
              amazing.

            <br>The fourth great lesson came when we thought the Lord wanted us to give to our church's building
              program.&nbsp; (Actually we borrowed $2,000, which we turned around and gave to the church for the
              building program.)&nbsp; Now $2,000 was &ndash; still is &ndash; a lot of money to us.&nbsp; All I&nbsp;wanted from
              God was for Him to make His presence in my life real to me in some way.&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't need to have
              financial blessings rain down on us (only because my thinking was too small then), but I&nbsp;wanted
              something, anything.  What happened instead was that within a week, both furnaces in our house
              went out.&nbsp; Replacing them cost us a couple thousand dollars (money we did not have).&nbsp; You can
              imagine how I&nbsp;was feeling.  Then, while working on our car (the battery died and I&nbsp;was
              trying to remove the cable to clean the post), the entire post of the battery pulled out.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was
              furious.&nbsp; I&nbsp;stormed in the house and fell on my knees.&nbsp; I&nbsp;asked God [read
              "respectfully demanded"], "Give me one good reason why I&nbsp;should ever pray for anything &ndash; just one&thinsp;!"
              I&nbsp;was so upset that I&nbsp;was completely exhausted.&nbsp; I&nbsp;skipped supper and went straight
              to bed (that was about 6 p.m.).&nbsp; Then, about midnight, I&nbsp;awoke with these words echoing in my
              head: "<i>Though He slay me, yet I&nbsp;will trust Him.</i>"  God had answered my prayer.&nbsp; I&nbsp;leapt
              out of bed and looked up the passage (Job 13:15).&nbsp; I&nbsp;have never doubted Him like that again.

              <br>The fifth great lesson came when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to undergo a
              double mastectomy, chemotherapy, and several reconstructions.&nbsp; Oh, did that one bring us low.&nbsp;
              By this time, though, we were stronger in our faith, so although we cried (and we cried ever so deeply),
              we nevertheless found ourselves continuing to praise Him, even through our tears.&nbsp; During this time
              we learned more about how much God loves us than at any other time in our lives.&nbsp; (It seems almost
              cruel that we must experience pain before we really know Love, but such is our human condition.)&nbsp;
              As we walked through that dark valley in our lives, the Lord directed me to C.S.&nbsp;Lewis' "The Problem
              of Pain" and "A Grief Observed" (the latter containing letters where Lewis shares his thoughts about his
              wife's death by cancer).&nbsp; My wife had survived two bouts with cancer, and although she remained in
              poor health, her indomitable and ever-cheerful spirit strengthened me and continued to bring delight to
              our life.

              <br>This lesson was by far the toughest.&nbsp; By that I&nbsp;mean my wife's health deteriorated significantly;
              this time from complications of Type-II Diabetes.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will not go into the details, but suffice it
              to say, as bad as it was, the cancer was a lot easier to face.&nbsp; At least, we knew that if the
              chemotherapy did not work, there would be an end to her suffering.&nbsp; This time, however, her suffering
              was worse &ndash; incredible pain and more.&nbsp; I&nbsp;kept asking God "why" my wife had to suffer so, but
              I&nbsp;received neither an answer nor relief for my wife.

              As Thanksgiving Day, 2004, approached, I&nbsp;didn't feel very thankful.&nbsp; Clearly, by any standard,
              I&nbsp;had much for which I&nbsp;should have been thankful.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am a citizen of the greatest
              nation on the earth today.  (I&nbsp;don't say that in a boasting prideful manner, but in humble
              gratitude &ndash; I&nbsp;could have been born in Darfur.)&nbsp; I&nbsp;had a good
              job.<small><sup><a href="#endnote_3">3</a></sup></small>&nbsp; Yes, I&nbsp;grumbled about this,
              that, and all the other things employees typically complain about, but it was, nevertheless, a job for
              which I&nbsp;should be very thankful &ndash; I&nbsp;could have been unemployed.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had a sweet wife who,
              although desperately ill then, had encouraged me and supported my labors all these years.&nbsp; If any
              good thing flows out of my life, it is due in large part to her.&nbsp; Even the success of our marriage
              is largely because of her love for myself and our sons.&nbsp; For that I&nbsp;remain ever thankful.

            <p>Speaking of our sons, we have two for which I&nbsp;should be very thankful.&nbsp; Gilbert is blind and
              suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, but he uses the one talent God has given him to its fullest, not hiding
              it, but serving and glorifying our God with it (see Luke 19:11-27 to understand the significance of
              that).  His older brother, Tony, is a man whose tremendous skill with his hands is exceeded only
              by his character as a man, a husband, and a father.&nbsp; No earthy father could be prouder of his son
              than I&nbsp;am of him.&nbsp; Our daughter-in-law is one most in-laws can only dream of having, and our
              two granddaughters are beautiful in both body and spirit.&nbsp; How could you not be thankful for them?&nbsp;
              And yet, I&nbsp;dreaded that Thanksgiving Day.&nbsp; What would I&nbsp;say at our Thanksgiving table when,
              as is our tradition, each recounts three things for which he or she is thankful?&nbsp; What could I&nbsp;say
              with my sweet wife suffering so?&nbsp; How could I&nbsp;be genuinely thankful for all my blessings, with
              her in such pain?

            <p>I&nbsp;cried to God about this repeatedly.&nbsp; "Life sucks," I&nbsp;told Him (thankfully, lightening
              remained in the heavens despite rants and ravings that bordered on insolence.)&nbsp; Then, the Sunday
              before Thanksgiving Day, I&nbsp;was reminded of what for which I&nbsp;should be MOST thankful: namely for
              His undying love toward us.&nbsp; I&nbsp;heard a pastor on the radio quote Psalm 106, verse 1.&nbsp;
              <i>"Give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever."</i>&nbsp; Good!&nbsp;
              Merciful!&nbsp; My wife is suffering unspeakably and &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I&nbsp;could
              continue my tirade, I&nbsp;was reminded of the following verse: <i>"I&nbsp;reckon that the sufferings of
              this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us"</i>
              (Romans 8:18).&nbsp; An unbelievable peace then flooded my soul as I&nbsp;recognized that <i>"the glory which
              shall be revealed in us,"</i> was purchased by Christ's willing sacrifice of Himself on the cross, on our
              behalf.&nbsp; That fact alone put "Thanksgiving Day" back into proper perspective.&nbsp; We must,
              I&nbsp;must, therefore, give thanks to the Lord for His mercy, for although I&nbsp;deserved hell itself
              (as do we all), He has so richly blest my wife and I&nbsp;with life eternal.&nbsp; <b><i>And my wife's
              sufferings,</i></b> which I&nbsp;would have done anything to remove, were still not to be compared with
              <i>"the glory which shall be revealed in us."</i>&nbsp; She suffered greatly, but the reality is that her
              glory would so far exceed her pains as to be incomparable.&nbsp; We remained distressed and deeply saddened
              by her condition (is that ever an understatement!), but we were at least, thankful to God during that
              season of Thanksgiving.&nbsp; For all the things listed above, yes,&nbsp; <i>and</i>&nbsp; for His goodness and mercy.

              <br>Through her cancers, we learned that our Father most likely did not bring this awful disease into our
              lives to test us or teach us important lessons about Him or about life.&nbsp; Neither did He bring (or allow)
              them because He knew that we were mature enough or tough enough to endure them.&nbsp; Knowing all, as He
              does, He already knew that we would face this trial (the future never surprises God).&nbsp; But our God is
              TOO BIG and we [read&nbsp; <i>me, myself</i>&thinsp;] far too frail for Him to have to bring such a trial
              into our lives just to teach us lessons.&nbsp; No, we will not limit His power by believing He has to use such awful
              diseases as these to teach us anything.&nbsp; I&nbsp;may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I&nbsp;know my
              God is not so limited.&nbsp; True, He did not intervene with miraculous healing, but He will, if we allow
              Him, turn even the darkest event in our lives into a blessing (what we call <i>blessings in black envelopes</i>).

            <br>Terry has been "Home Free" more than a decade now, and although I&nbsp;am no where near finished
              grieving for her (frankly, I&nbsp;may never be), God is clearly not finished with me yet either.&nbsp;
              I&nbsp;say this because in God's plan, and with Terry's hand directly involved and even with her blessing,
              I&nbsp;am now blest with another wonderful woman with whom I&nbsp;can share life.&nbsp; Her name is
              Mary&nbsp;Jane.&nbsp; (God knew it would take two extraordinary women to make me into the man He wants me
              to be.&nbsp; <i>That God loves me at all amazes me; that He loves me enough to give me two such wonderful
              women as Terry and Mary&nbsp;Jane is completely beyond my ability to understand.</i>)

            <p>Terry and I&nbsp;had known Mary&nbsp;Jane for nearly a score of years.&nbsp; When she was a student at
              Colorado Christian College, she stayed in our home for a short time.&nbsp; Eventually she felt led to change
              course in life.&nbsp; She moved to Seattle and later, returned to her family home in Santa Fe.&nbsp; Throughout
              that time, she remained a close family friend and stayed in constant contact with us, visiting
              often.&nbsp; As Terry's condition worsened, the frequency of Mary&nbsp;Jane's visits increased to monthly,
              even helping with memorial arrangements just days before Terry went home.

            <p>God's word tells us it is not good for man to be alone (Genesis&nbsp;2:18) and He knew I&nbsp;would not
              survive Terry's passing by myself (believe me, that is no exaggeration).&nbsp; Two thirds of my life,
              all but three years of my adulthood, spent with the most wonderful woman?&nbsp; How could I&nbsp;make it
              alone?&nbsp; Terry knew that as well, so in the year before she went home, she was preparing both
              Mary&nbsp;Jane and myself for our eventual union.

            <p>Knowing I&nbsp;would remarry (taking care of myself without her would be tough enough, but taking care
              of our blind and developmentally-disabled son as well, would be much more than I&nbsp;could handle)
              .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; knowing that, about a year before she died, Terry asked, "Have you considered
              Mary&nbsp;Jane?"&nbsp; I&nbsp;replied that as my wife she was my main concern and that I&nbsp;could not
              afford to think on such things.&nbsp; That was the absolute truth; I&nbsp;simply could not afford to think
              on such things at the time.&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;had considered Mary&nbsp;Jane &ndash; but dismissed the thought
              as soon as it entered my mind.&nbsp; Simply put, I&nbsp;preferred petite brunettes.&nbsp; Mary&nbsp;Jane
              is a tall blond.&nbsp; (As I&nbsp;write this it sounds soooo dumb, but what can I&nbsp;say.)

            <p>Although my feelings about Mary&nbsp;Jane began to change following Terry's passing, I&nbsp;didn't really
              think it would work.&nbsp; Mary&nbsp;Jane was enrolled in a radiology program in Santa&nbsp;Fe with two more
              years of education ahead of her.&nbsp; I&nbsp;thought, "I&nbsp;can't wait a long time; I'm not getting any
              younger."&nbsp; And frankly, after having spent a full two thirds of my life with the most wonderful woman,
              I&nbsp;desperately missed feminine intimacy &ndash; not just the physical relationship (sure, I&nbsp;missed that;
              I&nbsp;wasn't that old), but the companionship, the conversation, and the partnership.&nbsp; It also occurred to
              me that Mary&nbsp;Jane, who was 36 at the time and had never before married, had a father who is just 14
              years older than I.&nbsp; How would he take our union?&nbsp; Talk about a deck stacked against you!&nbsp;
              Everything told me this would not fly.

            <p>Mary&nbsp;Jane saw barriers of her own.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, one of her major concerns was that others
              would perceive her as the proverbial "maid in waiting."&nbsp; (I&nbsp;guess, in fact, she was &ndash; at least it
              seems by Terry's actions and God's will.)&nbsp; Mary&nbsp;Jane also wondered what Terry would think of our
              interest in each other.&nbsp; I&nbsp;told her I&nbsp;thought she would approve.&nbsp; That's the way Terry
              was &ndash; always wanting the best for others, always wanting the best for me.&nbsp; And as Mary&nbsp;Jane and
              I&nbsp;think back now, our interest in each other starts to look as if it was part of Terry's plan (or, as
              one of my friends suggested, "Terry's revenge on Mary&nbsp;Jane" <img src="images/face_smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face">&thinsp;).

            <br>Mary&nbsp;Jane has been such a comfort and a blessing.&nbsp; But, as great a wife as she is to me, she's
              been much, much more than I&nbsp;even hoped with our son, Gilbert.&nbsp; Although physically in his 40's,
              Gilbert is emotionally about 7 years old.&nbsp; He was born premature, the result of which was total blindness
              and an I.Q. of about 70.&nbsp; Terry and I&nbsp;took in Gilbert as a foster child when he was a year old;
              we adopted him about five years after that.&nbsp; As with everything, Terry was great with Gilbert &ndash;
              teaching him to walk and to take care of himself, learning Braille so that she could teach it him, even being
              his job coach for two years so that he could roll-n'wrap silverware at a local restaurant.&nbsp; As&nbsp;a result,
              Gilbert bonded to Terry like no one else.&nbsp; Needless to say, her passing (something he could not comprehend)
              was very, very hard on him, affecting his behavior in all the worst ways.&nbsp; Then comes Mary&nbsp;Jane.

            <p>Mary&nbsp;Jane poured her heart into helping and working with Gilbert, but he resisted everything she
              tried.&nbsp; However, to her credit, she did not let that stop her.&nbsp; Recognizing his behavior as some
              kind of developmental disability, Mary&nbsp;Jane sought help, even taking classes for parents with similarly
              developmentally-disabled children.&nbsp; In the process we discovered that Gilbert suffers from <i>Asperger's
              Syndrome</i> &ndash; a type of <i>Autism</i> (something neither Terry nor I&nbsp;ever suspected).&nbsp; He also
              suffers from Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).&nbsp; Although there
              are many possible symptoms of Asperger's syndrome, Gilbert's main symptom is total opposition (even hostility)
              to any kind of change in routine.&nbsp; (It doesn't take much to see how Terry's passing, followed by
              Mary&nbsp;Jane's appearance in the family &ndash; despite the fact that he'd known Mary&nbsp;Jane for
              as long as Terry and I&nbsp;had &ndash; exponentially exasperated that symptom.)

            <p>To make this story shorter, let me say that through Mary&nbsp;Jane's efforts, she and I&nbsp;have received
              the instruction needed to help us make Gilbert's life both happier and more productive.&nbsp; Neither Gilbert
              nor I&nbsp;could not have been more blest by the Lord, than we are by His giving us, Mary&nbsp;Jane.

              <br>Mary&nbsp;Jane's parents have read through the Bible more than 30 times in 30+ years.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Terry and
              I&nbsp;had been through it five times in our 40 years together.&nbsp; Following the great example of Mary Jane's
              parents, since our wedding Mary&nbsp;Jane and I&nbsp;have read through the Bible every year.&nbsp; What makes this a
              "Mile Marker" for myself is how much I&nbsp;have actually grown in my knowledge of, faith in, and love for our Lord
              during these years.&nbsp; In fact, I&nbsp;seem to have learned more this past year of going through His word than
              I&nbsp;did in all the years before (I&nbsp;know, I&nbsp;know, it is because I'm such a slow

              I&nbsp;deserve absolutely no credit for them.&nbsp; No doubt, I&nbsp;had a lot of work to do researching and putting them
