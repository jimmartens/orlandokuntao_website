            <p><b>Review by <a href="http://www.WimDemeere.com" target="blank_">Wim&nbsp;Demeere</a></b>
            <br>January 28, 2001.
            <p>Bob Orlando is a well known American Penchak Silat instructor.&nbsp; He has an extensive martial arts
              background including Silat, Kempo, Aikido, Iaido, Arnis de mano, and Eskrima.&nbsp; Despite perhaps not
              being the most mediatized person in the martial arts world, he has earned an impressive reputation as a
              highly skilled practitioner and even more so as a teacher.
            <p>He is the author of this video and two other books, which will be reviewed at a later date.
            <p>Mr.&nbsp;Orlando starts the tape by describing to the viewer that it's primary goal is not as much to
              teach techniques but more so to show the principles that make these techniques effective.&nbsp; To do
              this, he shows some basic techniques to work with, to facilitate explaining the principles.&nbsp; These
              techniques are block left, block right, strike left and strike right.
            <p>The first principle is "Adhesion".&nbsp; This is the concept of sticking close to the opponent in order
              to control him.&nbsp; The concept is then divided into strategic adhesion (sticking close by from start
              to finish, from first contact untill he is no longer a threat.) and tactical adhesion (specific techniques
              like the hacksaw and flipkick).&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando does state very clearly that adhesion is not a good
              idea against multiple opponents.
            <p>The second principle is "Whiplash", which is based on the fact that you can only resist force from one
              direction at a time.&nbsp; You can in fact use natural unvolontary reactions to your advantage.&nbsp;
              Bob then shows you how to combine Whiplash and Adhesion in an application.
            <p>Next is "Gyroscopic rotation".&nbsp; This concept is similar to the previous one but differs in the fact
              that it is a bit more "circular" in nature.
            <p>"Shearing" is next.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando explains this as two parallell but opposing lines that cross
              each other but don't converge.&nbsp; You can use this to manipulate the opponent, increase impacts or
              break bones, amongst other things.&nbsp; I&nbsp;especially liked this subject, as I&nbsp;vividly remember
              the first time my training partner applied this concept on me.&nbsp; He wasn't even hitting me that hard
              and my arm was sore for a week.
            <p>Another fundamental is "Seating" which can be sub-divided into active, passive, seating without direct
              impact and as an evasive maneuver.&nbsp; In essence, you are lowering your center of gravity by dropping
              or sinking into a number of stances.&nbsp; The variety of techniques you can derive of this principle
              alone is worth the price of the video.
            <p>"Leg maneuvers" includes stepping on and locking feet, or grinding an opponents leg.&nbsp; Bob shows a
              number of drills that teach you how to practice this concept.&nbsp; By applying this principle, you can
              do all kinds of nasty deeds to your opponent with such often neglected things as placing your feet in
              the most strategic spot.
            <p>This part reminded me of the "Ghost kicks" my teacher showed me while I&nbsp;was studying hard-style
              Wushu.&nbsp; These techniques don't look very impresive, but you have to feel them to believe their
              effectiveness.&nbsp; Or, you can allways pick a fight with a Silat player...
            <p>The last instructional segment of this tape is "Peanut brittle".&nbsp; Bob explains that it is a
              combination of Philipino flow drills and Indonesian concepts.&nbsp; In practice, this translates into
              a series of continuous blocks and counters in a variety of ways.&nbsp; The object is to absorb the
              techniques and grind them into your subconsciousness.
            <p>The tape ends with some words from Mr.&nbsp;Orlando regarding his purpose in making this tape and some
              other clarifications.
            <p><b>Interest:</b>
            <font color="blue">
              Without a doubt, this is one of the best tapes I&nbsp;have ever had the good fortune to stumble upon.&nbsp;
              If you are into Silat, then this is a "must have" tape.&nbsp; If you are training in another martial art,
              you'd better view this tape too.&nbsp;
            </font>
              The concepts that are explained in it can be found, to some extent in Aikido, Wing Chun, Karate, Tai Chi
              Chuan and many other arts.&nbsp; Few teachers are aware of these concepts, even though they might
              subconsciously understand them.&nbsp; Others try to keep this information to themselves or classify
              it as "secret teachings" and refuse to disclose it.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando deserves credit and applause
              for sharing this much and especially for explaining it in a clear and pleasant way.
            <p>This brings me to one of the fundamental strong points of the tape: Mr.&nbsp;Orlando shows and explains
              the principles in such a way, that they are easy to understand.&nbsp; There is no excess of information
              that would clutter your mind.&nbsp; Neither does he imitate the clich‚ of the "Master" who uses
              three-word phrases and then demonstrates once (at full speed) the techniques, leaving you to wonder what
              actually just happened.
            <p>Bob also seems to be enjoying himself all the time and jokes around a bit.&nbsp; The sardonic laughter
              as he shoots a hacksaw into his partners ribs is but one nice example.
            <p><b>Quality:</b> The tape is of excellent quality.&nbsp; There are many different viewing angles and
              speeds are varied to allow a better understanding of the material.&nbsp; Very impressive.
