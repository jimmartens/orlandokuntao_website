            <br>October 22, 2003 <img src="images/stars-2-0.gif" border="0" width="64" height="12" alt="2 out of 5 stars">

            <p>While this book makes some interesting points it comes across more as an anti-tradition propaganda piece
              than a useful treatise on martial arts.&nbsp; My problem with that approach is that while boxing, wrestling,
              and other sports are currently associated with name-calling, ear biting, tattooed freaks, Asian martial arts
              have managed to maintain much of their dignity, ostensibly through an adherence to the traditions of such art
              forms.

            <p>This is compounded by the fact that several sections are grossly inaccurate.&nbsp; For example, the author
              states that, "today's full-contact fighters throw devastating, lightning fast punches from a distance of less
              than two feet.&nbsp; Against this kind of speed, classical blocks and punches simply do not stand a chance.&nbsp;
              What amazes me is how a flaw of this magnitude - and one that is taught to thousands of unknowing students every
              day - still exists in what are, otherwise, extremely potent arts..."  Sorry to be blunt, but this kind of
              nonsense just pisses me off.

            <p>Contrary to Mr. Orlando's understanding, in classical blocks the hand that is out (e.g. just punched or
              blocked) performs the actual block, check, or deflection, while the hand that is in chamber executes a
              technique designed to control the opponent's limb.&nbsp; Even though it is often hidden, almost all blocks
              in traditional karate styles utilize this check/control methodology.&nbsp; In all cases, there is never ever
              any "wind-up" preceding anything.

            <p>To delve deeper, the word Uke translates more accurately to "receive" than it does to "block."&nbsp; When
              viewed in this context, it may be easier to understand that practitioners typically check, deflect, or control
              an attack rather than meeting it force-on-force.&nbsp; Using the traditional check/control methodology,
              a practitioner's outstretched hand need only deflect an attack by a few inches to spoil its effect when contact
              is made close to an opponent's body.&nbsp; In this fashion Karateka can easily avoid being hit by even the most
              "devastating" of punches no matter how fast, or how powerfully, or even how unexpectedly they are thrown.

            <p>Don't get me wrong; I&nbsp;certainly do not believe that the author is an idiot.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe that he
              is the victim of bad teaching.&nbsp; Common misconceptions such as this one are the reason that I&nbsp;believe
              it is imperative to supplement the traditional modeling approach to martial arts instruction with interactive
              discussions and other teaching styles.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hate to see this sort of stuff perpetuated.

            <p>Now that I've ripped him down, I&nbsp;will point out that there are some redeeming concepts in this book.&nbsp;
              For example, the author also promotes practicing martial arts in the same sort of attire one might be wearing
              in real life.&nbsp; If you have spent your whole life barefoot in a Dojo, training with loose fitting clothes,
              you may well be in for a shock the first time you have to fight in tight-fitting jeans wearing boots.&nbsp;
              This is a valid point.&nbsp; I&nbsp;agree that practitioners should devote some of their training to more
              realistic conditions though that often must occur at their home rather than in a tradition karate school.

            <p>All in all, however, there is not enough meat in this book to spend your hard earned dollars purchasing it.

                there will be some for whom change in the art is especially abhorrent.&nbsp; These individuals are too
                deeply invested and entrenched in their particular systems and methods to even recognize the need for change,
                much less accept it.&nbsp; The ostrich may bury his head in the sand, but simply not seeing the truth never
                changes it.<br>&nbsp;
