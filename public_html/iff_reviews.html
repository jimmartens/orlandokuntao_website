            <p><b>About this title:</b>The fighting arts of Indonesia, a mix of pentjak silat and Chinese kuntao, were never meant for sport:
              they are brutal, unrelenting and designed to take the enemy out and punish him every step of the way.&nbsp; This unprecedented
              book by a long-time student of Dutch-Indonesian Master Willem de&nbsp;Thouars shows you why.
              <p><b>Note:</b> This is a general synopsis.

              <p><b>Oh.. so that what it actually means</b>
              <p>I only learned Pencak Silat for two months in high school, simply because it was part of the
              curriculum.&nbsp; Some Sundanese style I don't even know the name.&nbsp; Like many other Indonesians
              I know, I considered pencak silat as silly, ineffective, traditional, etc. ... in short, learn karate,
              jujitsu, tae kwon do, or any other martial art... but not silat... (shame on us, but it is the popular
              perception).&nbsp; Reading this book I looked back at the only two jurus I know, and realized that
              there was more in there than some silly dance...&nbsp; Now I am a proud Indonesian.&nbsp; However,
              I doubt that many Indonesian masters really understand the materials they are teaching... this is
              really a remarkable work of Indonesian art from Western perspective.<p>A great thank you to Mr.&nbsp;Orlando.<br>&nbsp;

              <p><b>Bob made complicated Silat topics easy to understand</b>
              <p>I have studied a variety of martial arts over the past twenty years.&nbsp; While I have had limited exposure to Silat,
              I find it fascinating.&nbsp; A few years ago, I read Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals by Bob Orlando.&nbsp; Bob made
              complicated Silat topics easy to understand.&nbsp; I have reread the book several times now and I always find something
              I missed.&nbsp; Even if you don't practice Silat, this book will probably show you something you didn't understand in
              another art.&nbsp; The deeper your knowledge in the martial arts, the more they all start to blend together.
              <p>I recently took a business trip to Colorado and asked Bob if I could come train at his school.&nbsp; I was surprised
              when Bob agreed.&nbsp; Bob spent the class working with me one on one sharing his ideas, philosophy, techniques, and
              humor.&nbsp; Bob is a great martial artist, teacher, and human being.&nbsp; I don't give out my recommendations lightly,
              but this book deserves a spot in every martial artists library.
              <p>Thank you, Bob!

              <p><b>Not Worth The Price</b>
              <p>I bought this book hoping I would pick up on some new techniques, principles or concepts I could
              integrate into my style. Which is based on Karate, Jeet kune do, akido, and kung fu. I did pick up on
              some things I could combine with my system. However, I don't think the book or the system is worth all
              the hype that has been given to it. I guess its just because the system is so limited from my point of
              view.&nbsp; . . .
              <p>Some may say this is a grown up book for black belts.&nbsp; That may be.&nbsp; I'm a black belt and
              I don't think&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Sure I picked up a few new concepts and principles that I may be able
              to apply to my style but I don't think those few concepts were worth the money I paid for the book.&nbsp;
              If it covered all possible types of attacks from other styles, and combined leg tactics the book would be
              worth the money but, I feel the "style" falls short of "Real" combat situations you may find yourself
              in.<br>&nbsp;

              [emphasis added].&nbsp; His reason though for doing this is that he is a Christian and doesn't believe in
              chi or the mystical stuff.&nbsp; I do understand and respect his decision in doing so.&nbsp; The book does
              show not really techniques but rather drills to understand body movement from which all techniques come
              form.&nbsp; Overall it's very recommended for simplicity in explaining the flow and feel of Pentjak
              Silat.&nbsp; Again no disrespect for the author or his choice of worship.

                  A fair criticism.&nbsp; Perhaps the following paragraphs (the first from the book's <i>Introduction</i>,
                  and the second from <i>Magic and Mysticism</i> chapter) from will explain why I omitted
                  <font color="blue">history</font> and the <font color="darkred">"mystical" side of Pentjak</font>.

                    culture, or many fighting systems of Indonesia.&nbsp; One would be hard pressed to create a work that
                    exceeds the late Donn Draeger's, Weapons and Fighting Arts of Indonesia.&nbsp; His is the definitive
                    Western work on Indonesian fighting arts, and is "must" reading for anyone interested in Indonesia's
                    martial <font color="blue">history</font> and culture (p. 1).
                    <br>&nbsp;<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;Setting aside religious incompatibility, there is another reason why Dutch and
                    Dutch-Indonesian practitioners [those from whom I studied] remained on the physical side of the
                    fence: Practicality.&nbsp; To the Dutch, studying magic as a means of self-defense made little
                    sense.&nbsp; Magic for self-defense was a waste of time because its effectiveness is, at best,
                    questionable; at its worst, nonexistent.&nbsp; Few Western minds are willing to accept claims
                    of physical prowess without physical contact, and the Dutch are no exception.&nbsp; From both
                    religious and secular perspectives then, Dutch students were inclined to seek out teachers who,
                    like themselves, also had little time for the magical/<font color="darkred">mystical</font> side of
                    the art (p. 158).

             <p><b>The principles are essential</b>
             <p>The title is a little deceiving.&nbsp; This book doesn't really profile silat or kuntao.&nbsp;
             Rather, it is one of the best books on concepts that I've ever read.&nbsp; I'd place it up there with
             "Tao of Jeet Kune Do".&nbsp; The concepts of gyroscopic rotation, shearing, adhesion, etc. can be
             applied to any art, given a little imagination.&nbsp; While the reader will learn something on the
             history of Indonesian martial arts, it is really the underlying principle that receive the most
             attention.&nbsp; One won't really learn HOW to do silat or kuntao, but will gain an understanding
             of WHY the practitioners of such arts do the things they do.&nbsp; There is nothing on weapons,
             which I thought was strange, and nothing on Kali, which I thought was Indonesian, but that doesn't
             take away from the fact that this is one of the best books on martial arts principles out there.&nbsp;
             No matter whether one is looking for aesthetics, self-defense, understanding the "arts", or sporting
             aspects of martial arts, there is something in this book for everyone.&nbsp; I'd recommend it to
             anyone serious about the martial arts, but those with a more casual attitude towards the arts may not
             find anything useful here.&nbsp; If I could only have five martial arts books, this would be one of them.<br>&nbsp;

             <p><b>An Excellent Overview of Fighting/Movement Concepts</b>
             <p>Author Bob Orlando has written something which is sadly rare these days: a martial arts book for people
             who think.&nbsp; If like many, you scan through a book and just look at the pictures, you will probably be
             unimpressed with the volume of techniques.&nbsp; If,on the other hand, you actually READ this book, you
             will be presented with material which cannot help but enhance the martial art which you practice.
             &nbsp; . . . &nbsp; I held off on buying this book for years (primarily because of the price), but now I
             could kick myself for procrastinating.&nbsp; This book is written in a straightforward and reader-friendly
             style, and the photos are large enough and show enough contrast to clearly demonstrate the ideas
             represented.&nbsp; I'm kind of stingy with five star ratings, but this book is clearly deserving.

             <p>This book is an excellent example of what authors should more often do: Instead of just rehashing the
             same material (the principles), Bob gives you much more information on several topics that aren't included
             in the video.&nbsp; As a result, both the book and video are excellent companions for each other.&nbsp;
             You can read the book and then see the principles come to life in the video.&nbsp; However, once you've
             seen all this, there is even more to ponder when reading.

             <p>It's rare indeed that a martial arts book can teach a reader much that they can incorporate into their
             own practice: usually the techniques that they teach are too difficult to learn from a book, or so simple
             that any student knows them already.&nbsp; But by focusing on principles and logic of combat rather than
             on specific techniques, Bob Orlando gives the student of martial arts not only insight into Indonesian
             styles but methods of practice and training which a student of virtually any art can incorporate into their own.
             <p>In addition, this book is an excellent companion to Orlando's video "Fighting Arts of Indonesia".&nbsp;

             <p>Orlando writes that his intent is not "a detailing [of] the history, culture, or many fighting systems

             training and study is effective self-defense" to this end he has succeeded marvelously.&nbsp; The author
             accurately portrays the use of a wide variety of Indonesian strikes and stances, effectively demonstrating
             their differences with other fighting styles, the principles behind their actions, and their use in combat
             situations.&nbsp; His own sometimes creative terminology &mdash; my personal favorite being "gyroscopic rotation"
             &mdash; actually enhances the student's understanding than if the author had attempted to translate those actions
