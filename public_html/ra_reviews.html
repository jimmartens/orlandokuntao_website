                      <p><b>Thank You For Your Videos</b>
                      <p>I purchased your&nbsp; <i>Fighting Arts of Indonesia,</i>&nbsp; <i>Reflex Action</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp;
                      <i>Fighting Forms of Kuntao-Silat</i>&nbsp; videos and I must say these videos are real gems.&nbsp;
                      I've been involved in Martial Arts since 8 years of age and am now 61 &ndash; I've studied Judo,
                      Shotokan, Taijiquan, Xingyiquan and earned Shodan rank in American Kenpo, and your videos are so
                      refreshing&nbsp; I felt I should tell you.
                      <p>Thanks a million,

                      <p>Kevin

                      <p>This is a keeper set.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando has a wealth of knowladge, and does a great job helping
                        one understand the ins and outs of his interpretation of a blend of arts.&nbsp; A great piece of

                      <p><b>My favorite of his group</b>
                      <p>As I&nbsp;may have said in earlier reviews, I&nbsp;am new to Silat and with that,
                        this training  is suited for those just getting started.&nbsp; He [Bob&nbsp;Orlando] goes
                        over the basics in great detail and uses analogies to make key points clear.&nbsp;
                        If you're interested in learning Silat, these DVD's will reinforce the key principles
                        of Silat and make some of the mysitical aspects more clear.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would highly
                        suggest this set for the Silat newcomer and almost would feel you'd be missing something
                        if you didn't check it out.&nbsp; For those on the fence, understand that Silat is an
                        excellent fighting system.&nbsp; If you're the type that wants to do flipping fly kicks
                        and be the next Jet Li, Silat won't be your cup of tea.&nbsp; If you are however looking
                        to learn a fighting skill that can be applied in an urban situation, look no furthur.&nbsp;
                        I'd also suggest looking into Kali, also known as Escrima and Arnis as well.&nbsp;
                        Krav Maga may also be of interest as well as I believe the novice student should be open
                        to the fact that all the Martial Arts offer something.<p>In close, BUY THIS DVD!!!&nbsp;
                        You won't be sorry.&nbsp; Also check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUohrOqJ4LY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
                        as I've seen clips of this DVD out there so you can see for yourself.<br>&nbsp;

                        <br>July 5, 2008<p><b>Bob Orlando's DVDs</b>
                        <p>I was just watching Bob&nbsp;Orlando's DVDs called
                        <a href="books_and_videos.html#ra_jump" >Reflex Action</a>.&nbsp;
                        This series is on hand drills with an indepth explanation of how to use them.&nbsp;
                        In&nbsp;Part 1, Bob teaches the basic hand drills of his system of Kuntao-Silat and even
                        shows you how build hand drills from your present system.&nbsp;
                        <font face="Verdana,Arial" size="-1">...</font>&nbsp; Once you learn this, then put in the
                        <a href="books_and_videos.html#ff_jump" >Fighting Footwork of Kuntao And Silat</a>
                        [DVD] and watch you gain a new respect for the art.&nbsp; ...
                      <p>My recommendation is to buy both of these [video] series to gain a greater understanding of
                        Kuntao-Silat and how to use the high-line through hand drills and the low-line through
                        <i>Fighting Footwork</i>.&nbsp; As far as I'm concerned anyone wanting to learn more about
                        Kuntao-Silat needs these video series.&nbsp; By the way, you may want to buy the
                        <a href="books_and_videos.html#fai_jump">Fighting Arts of Indonesia: Combat Secrets of Kuntao And Silat</a>
                        he makes a lot of reference to it in <i>Reflex Action</i>.&nbsp; I am not an instructor that
                        is impressed very easily; however <i>Bob really impressed me with his knowledge and skill</i>

                        <p>I wanted to thank you for the master class you gave at the
                        [<a href="http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com" target="_blank">Marc&nbsp;MacYoung</a>]
                        Animal List BBQ a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really appreciated it and have
                        subsequently invested in your videos.&nbsp; These are without a doubt the best flow drills
                        I've seen.&nbsp; As advertised, your reflex drills are of universal interest, rather than
                        being specific to one art.&nbsp; Excellent!<br>&nbsp;

                        elbows, forearms, knees and feet, and shows you how to turn them all into a skill set that

                        <br>January 16, 2003
                      <p>When I first saw the video I had a hard time processing the information they hold.&nbsp;
                        Not that it wasn't presented in a clear fashion, it is.&nbsp; It's just that there's so much
                        of it.&nbsp; Throughout the video, Bob gives you tons of information to work with and many
                        different ways to do the drills.&nbsp; But it goes further than that.&nbsp; He not only shows
                        you the drills he uses but goes into detail as to how and why they work.&nbsp; This gives you
                        the tools you need to devise your own drills, using techniques from your own art.&nbsp; This
                        will allow you to speed up the learning process tremendously and help ingrain what it teaches.
                        <p>Throughout the video, he keeps things fun to watch by cracking jokes or whacking his
                        partners and the looks on their faces are priceless.&nbsp; Especially when Bob works with
                        "Tiny", this stands out.&nbsp; It is important because you will need to view the video many
                        times over to get the full benefit.&nbsp; There are the drills themselves but that is just
                        the most obvious part.&nbsp; Once you start experimenting with them, you will quickly feel
                        the need to watch them again to see how exactly you perform the details of Mr.&nbsp;Orlando's
                        techniques and really make the drills come to life.&nbsp; Seeing him move is an education in
                        and of itself.&nbsp; He has extremely good technical skills and the refinement of decades of
                        training is obvious.&nbsp; Without a doubt, one of the most impressive martial artists I have
                        ever seen.<p>If you are a Silat, Kuntao or Kali player, this video should be on top of your
                        list of &nbsp;<i>"Must buy!"</i>&nbsp; items.&nbsp; If you train in an art that doesn't
                        emphasize drills, you can use them to create your own.&nbsp; At any rate, <b>buy the video.&nbsp;
