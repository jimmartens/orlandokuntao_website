            <p><b>Review by&nbsp; Rick&nbsp;Robinson</b>
            <br>June 18, 2001.
            <p>Bob Orlando has presented a fine video that is full of useful techniques, but even better; he teaches
              five principles of his arts that can be applied in any situation.&nbsp; He also shows both hand, and footwork,
              drills that one may use to help develop speed, and flow.

            <p>The five principles that Mr. Orlando shows are: Adhesion, Whiplash, Gyroscopic Rotation, Seating and
              Shearing.&nbsp; <i>Adhesion</i>, where the defender first takes the ground from the attacker by moving his
              defense through the attacker's position, then the defender sticks as closely to the attacker as possible as
              he continues his technique.&nbsp; <i>Whiplash</i>, where the defender's techniques use a counter at one level
              and a brace at another so that the defender might brace the attackers body with one arm as he snaps the head
              back with the other.&nbsp; This differs from many other arts bracing technique where the defender might
              hold the back of the head or neck and use an elbow smash to the front.&nbsp; The effect does cause a
              whiplash effect when used as above, but may also be used in a scissors type takedown, or many other ways
              that are demonstrated on the tape.&nbsp;

            <p>Another concept is <i>Seating</i>, the defender uses his own body to pin the attacker once he is down,
              often dropping both knees, while maintaining balance, onto the attackers body and neck.&nbsp; By learning
              these, and the other, principles one does not simply add more techniques to one's arsenal, but one learns
              how to create their own techniques, and better understand and apply the ones already known!

            <p>The last part of the tape has several footwork, hand work, and foot and hand drills that one can actually
              use with a partner to enhance speed and flow, and make their practice sessions more enjoyable.&nbsp; I&nbsp;love
              using drills for my classes, and I&nbsp;have gleefully stolen several from this tape.&nbsp; Some of the
              footwork drills use an unbalancing technique followed by a nifty little "flip kick" that I&nbsp;used to
              surprisingly good effect when I&nbsp;sparred with my students last week.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will definitely
              keep this technique, and work on it.

            <p>The tape's quality is very good in both visual and sound.&nbsp; The background is plain and dark enough
              to make it easy to see the techniques presented.

            <p>Because of the manner of presentation on the tape, the cross over appeal is tremendous!&nbsp; I&nbsp;can
              definitely recommend this tape to any  serious martial artist.

            <p>In my opinion,
            <p>Sensei Rick Robinson
