            <br>My friend was right.  Forms training really is underappreciated.  Television today is full of mixed
              martial artists whose training focuses for the most part, on strength, takedowns, submission holds and sparring,
              and all that within a framework of specific safety <a href="UFC_rules.html">rules</a>.<small><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></small>

            <p>Forms training is far from the mind of most of such young, strong competitors dreaming of fame and
              glory.  Interestingly, that is a lot like I&nbsp;felt in my earlier years of training.
              No wonder my friend asked why I&nbsp;would come out with a forms video when the martial arts world
              is so focused on other things.  How did&nbsp;I, in fact, move from one who really did not
              appreciate forms, to the place now where I&nbsp;would never even consider eliminating them from
              our training curriculum?

            <p>As I&nbsp;considered my own change in forms appreciation, I&nbsp;realized that forms practice actually
              gave me specific <i>practical skills</i> which I&nbsp;could put to use in the other aspects
              of my martial arts training, practice, and even in everyday life.  Forms study also opened my eyes
              to <i>strategic thinking</i>, learning to flow naturally from defense to offense, stance to stance,
              and foe to foe.  Through the years of practice I&nbsp;found that I&nbsp;also gained the invaluable
              <i>perspective of time</i>, learning from experience that life-long martial artists invariably
              undergo changes in their own strength and physical capabilities, and that forms-study and training can
              actually help them adapt and even improve their effectiveness despite the challenges of aging.
              Finally, I&nbsp;recognized that forms are actually a significant contributor to having a truly
              <i>complete system of training</i>, and are an essential complement to drills, physical conditioning,
              bag work, and a host of other training methods.  In what follows, I&nbsp;will attempt to explain each
              of those points in the hope that in the end, you too, will have a greater appreciation of the value of forms
              training.  Let us begin.

              could all be addressed here listing the benefits of each training tool and method,
              but frankly, the value of those "training tools and methods" is not in question here.  Allow us, then,
              to jump right in to the practical skills that are to be gained from forms training.  After that, we will
              address the consistent and very natural reasons why it takes so long to recognize and appreciate forms training.

              Simply put, forms study and training teach you primarily two things: One mental, one physical.
              Remember the movie Braveheart?  In the scene where the Scottish farmers perform their own traditional
              burial service for William's father and brother, young William takes the sword from his uncle Argyle
              (played by Brian Cox) and tries to lift it.  His uncle slowly and gently takes the sword back and
              then says to young William,
              <blockquote>
                &nbsp;<Font color="firebrick">First, learn to use this ...</font>
                <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <small>as he taps young William's forehead</small>.<img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="22" border="0">

                <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <small>lifts the huge sword.</small>
              </blockquote>
              Forms training teaches us just that &ndash; to use our minds, before  and then, along with our bodies.

            <p>Mentally, forms training teaches strategic thinking.  Physically, it is simply,
              <b>how</b> to move.  We will look at the "how," the physical side,
              in a moment, but first, let us examine the mental side, the <i>strategic thinking</i>.

              <br>As hand drills train the hands, so leg drills train the legs.  Techniques, in turn, integrate
              the previously trained limbs into a&nbsp;coordinated defense.  All of that can be
              accurately described as fighting tactics.  By "tactics," we mean that for the most part,
              the student is practicing a&nbsp;technique &ndash; either with a&nbsp;training partner or solo &ndash;
              with a focus on the immediate "battle" before him.  <i>Tactics</i> are the "how" to implementing battle
              <i>strategy</i>.  Like the squad leader in the field, the defender's focus is rightly
              limited to the methods needed to overcome the adversary immediately before him.  Training drills
              and techniques are really only suited to equip the martial artist to effectively fire using
              his arms and legs, and that only toward the threat before him.  Little thought at that level
              is given to protecting his flank or preparing for other potential threats.  As the squad
              leader moves up to platoon leader or company commander, his vision must expand to see beyond the
              immediate threat before him.  His thinking must broaden from the narrower-focused battle tactics
              to the broader campaign or battle strategy.

            Strategic training goes beyond techniques or tactics, assuming, among other things, a&nbsp;longer
            running conflict with multiple assailants.  Combat on such a&nbsp;field requires more than just
            trained arms and legs, more than just tactically coordinated techniques designed to defend against
            a&nbsp;single anticipated assault and lasting only seconds.  Combat in that field requires total
            body and mind integration and coordination &ndash; something that has been thought out and worked
            through frequently in a variety of ways long before you get into such a fight.  When the serious
            fight breaks out and your body is slammed with adrenaline, that is <i>not</i> the time to
            think about strategy.  Training time is the time to so think, and forms training is well
            designed to meet that critical need.

            <br>I&nbsp;said before that the physical skill taught by forms is simply, "<b>how</b>
              to move."  That is, how to move from man to man, assailant to assailant, transitioning
              smoothly through various assaults in a&nbsp;variety of ways, all without tripping over your own or someone
              else's feet.  With a&nbsp;reasonable number of good forms then, one can easily imagine how many different
              defenses are presented for say, kicking attacks: kicks coming at you from your left, your right, in front, at
              varying angles, <i>and</i> to different targets (groin, body, legs, etcetera).  Sure, the
              attacks are choreographed,<small><sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></small> but the order of
              the various attacks is really unimportant!  What is important
              is training your ability to move from man to man, actually flowing like water from one defense to another,
              effectively using the variety of stances available to you along with all the other tactical skills
              acquired through your training.  What other training tool provides that?
              Or, perhaps, a better question is, "Do you even see a&nbsp;need for such training, and if so, <i>how do
              you meet that need?</i>" For us, forms training more than adequately meets that critical
              requirement.  Let me share just one real life example of the success of that kind of training.

              <br>At my granddaughter's birthday celebration held at <i>The Country Buffet Restaurant</i>, I&nbsp;was filling three
              large glasses with raspberry ice tea at the beverage dispensers.  Beside me was an old octogenarian filling his
              coffee mug.  As I&nbsp;started to leave with our three full drinks carefully in hand, the old man suddenly turned
              right at me!  Contorting my body through a silat-like bagua-style turn, I&nbsp;managed to miss him completely
              <i>and</i> without spilling a single drop!  A&nbsp;waitress who apparently saw the whole thing came over immediately
              and said something like, "that was soooooo cool!  The way you danced around that old guy was incredible!"
              Even before the waitress spoke, I&nbsp;knew instantly from where I&nbsp;got that ability to move &ndash; from forms
              training.  Because that elderly gentleman's coffee could just as easily have been a knife wielded by some thug in
              the street, that simple, non-life-threatening incident proved to me that learning to move that smoothly can actually keep
              someone safe in a real fight.  Living proof that truly effective <i>martial</i>&thinsp; art training depends more on
              strategic movement than vigorous motion.

            <p>"Good forms" have already been mentioned, but for forms training to be truly effective, two more things
              are equally critical:  time and good teachers.  Good teachers should be obvious, but such teachers can
              be hard to find.  My friend, Michael Smith, accurately described "good teachers" like this.
              <blockquote>
                Such teachers must retain the belief that there is value in preserving something in the way that it
                was taught to you in order for future generations to think about, ponder and glean from it what <i>they</i>
                can.  Just, because I&nbsp;think something is useless doesn't mean someone else in the future (or
                perhaps myself in future years when I&nbsp;am hopefully wiser) can not make some great advancements in
                martial arts from studying the material.
              </blockquote>
              Frankly, it is tough to find teachers with that kind of humble insight.

              <p><font face="Verdana" size="+2"><b>The Perspective of Time</b></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
              <br>My friend's "future years" comment points directly to the third critical element needed to appreciate
              forms training &ndash; namely, time.  Samuel Butler's words so graciously grasp and present that truth.
              <blockquote>
                "Youth is like spring, an over-praised season more remarkable for biting winds than genial breezes.
                Autumn is the mellower season, and what we lose in flowers we more than gain in fruits."
              </blockquote>

            <p>In the last decade I&nbsp;have really begun to see the value of forms training.  Is it because I&nbsp;am
              older and weaker?  Without a doubt, I&nbsp;am older, and though I&nbsp;regularly and vigorously workout
              at the gymnasium, I&nbsp;also recognize that I&nbsp;am not as strong as I&nbsp;was thirty years ago.
              But do you know what?  I&nbsp;actually strike faster and hit harder now than I&nbsp;did thirty years
              ago.  And I&nbsp;move far, far more efficiently than I&nbsp;did back then as well.  I&nbsp;am older
              now and not as strong as I&nbsp;once was, but that is <b>not</b> why I&nbsp;appreciate forms more
              now!  Although age is not directly the key to appreciation, it is still so indirectly.  For some of
              us, forms appreciation only comes with <i>time</i> (which in many cases means "as we get older")
              and such a journey may look like we come appreciate forms simply because we can do nothing else.
              But that is simply not so!  Allow me to share just three of the many natural parallels in life that
              show the difference time makes in appreciating many things.

            <p>We have already shared Samuel Butler's great quote, but consider my friend, Michael Smith's thought.
              He says, "Forms are kind of like songs: You may not really like or appreciate them all that much at first,
              but they <i>can</i> grow on you with time."  Another equally natural parallel in life comes from
              cooking.  Ingredients are absolutely critical to cooking anything, no question, but so is time.
              Cook something that requires an 50 minutes 325 degrees.  Instead, cook it for only 20 minutes &ndash; even
              at 500 degrees &ndash; and you will very likely NOT appreciate the result.  Again, appreciation and
              value assumes that you first have good forms (music or ingredients) to begin with and good teachers
              (singers, musicians, and cooks) with which you can study.  But here is my favorite example of how
              <i>time</i> naturally changes perspectives and subsequent appreciation of anything.  Consider boys
              and girls.

            the young woman go through the roof!  But even then, such appreciation is largely a short-lived,
            tongue-hanging-out-of-the-mouth desire.  In&nbsp;truth, it really takes a man being wed thirty or more
            years to the same woman to really come to appreciate her &ndash; an appreciation that goes well beyond
            the physical.  Forms study and appreciation, in fact, parallels that &ndash; we simply have to see
            them over time (years sometimes) to truly appreciate their value.

              <br>Another issue needs to be addressed here, one that ties directly to the age of the practitioner.
              This issue, naturally coupled with youth, actually raises a significant challenge to forms study and
              training.  That issue is <i><b>talent</b></i>.  That's right, gifted, natural talent &ndash;
              talent the individual possessed before he ever started training.  Does anyone really believe Bruce
              Lee<small><sup>&nbsp;<a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></small> was as good as he was based solely on his
              training?  Of course not.  He was a very gifted and highly talented young man whose training
              actually focused and amplified his own almost supernatural talent.
            <br>&nbsp;<a name="fn4_back"></a>
            <br>Unless properly introduced to forms training (from a good teacher exploring good forms), then the
              younger,<small><sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></small> gifted and naturally talented students
              &ndash; those who are either stronger, larger, or faster than most of us &ndash; those talented individuals
              may never come to fully appreciate forms training precisely <i>because of</i> their talent.
              How come?  Because their training will only be focused on those things that build on their natural
              talent.

            <p>Further, <i>youth</i> blocks vision precisely because it lacks experience!  How many newly wed
              young men are prepared for marriage and all the marital issues that involves?  Unless the young man
              had great parents from whom he learned a lot about marriage, by their example and counsel, he is unprepared!
              That same truth looms over martial arts training (and all of life for that matter) just as strongly.
              Add to that the gift of natural physical talent and the equally natural focus that trains according to that
              strength, and now you have a serious challenge to any appreciation of forms training.

            <p>The problem with talent is that one often says, "I&nbsp;don't need forms training.  I'm
              strong enough" or "I&nbsp;am big enough" or "I&nbsp;am fast enough that I&nbsp;don't need anything
              else."  It is precisely this combination of lack of experience and natural talent that
              provides the strongest challenge to forms study.  As we say in our
              "<a href="training_smarter.html" title="Training Smarter, Not Harder article">Training Smarter</a>"
              article, aging and injury can actually be your friends.  As much as they hurt, they at least
              force us to look at other training tools and methods that we might not seriously consider otherwise.

             <p>Oh how I would have loved to have been so physically talented.  But alas, I&nbsp;am not.  Worse,
              I&nbsp;have experienced physical maladies coupled with the natural aging process that have made the study
              of martial arts difficult.  But all that falls under the "Experience" heading and it is precisely that
              experience that forced me to look into all areas of martial arts to develop ever-improving skills.
              I&nbsp;have a friend who is incredibly strong and weighs over 300 pounds.  He often says things like,
              "In that situation I&nbsp;would just grab him and do ... [whatever]".

             <p>His strength and size are precisely  why he has trouble seeing the value in so many of the other things
              we do!  Many who do not appreciate forms training are, relatively speaking, young, strong, and/or
              talented.  Seeing the benefits of forms study and training are hard, at best, for such individuals
              to even recognize, much less appreciate.

             <p>Those of us lacking our once youthful strength and/or  natural physical talent, can no longer
              <i>totally rely</i> on those gifts to defend ourselves.  So we open our eyes and look at
              anything that might contribute to the continuing development of our martial skills.  For those
              of us so blest, that includes forms training.

            We briefly touched on this before, but all the preceding arguments are totally dependent on two things:
            1)&nbsp;Good, content-rich forms, and 2)&nbsp;Good teachers &ndash; teachers who do more than just fill
            the student's training time with solo practice.  Regarding the forms themselves: Unfortunately, the
            critics are correct, <i>bad forms suck</i>; they truly deserve all the bad press they
            receive.  But all too often, instead of seeking good forms from good teachers, critics simply throw
            the baby out with the bath water.  That is really sad.  Perhaps, as time marches on and their
            youth, natural strength and speed diminish, and they are fortunate enough to observe an "interesting" form,
            they just might reevaluate their view of "good forms" training and diligently seek such from a good
            teacher.  Which brings us once again to "good teachers."

              <i>with understanding.</i> From such a teacher,<small><sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></small>
              the student should come to see every movement and technique in a form as placing him in the middle of
              the given movement's or technique's possibilities.  From there, applications can be developed fully
              with various training partners &ndash; tall, short, heavy, ugly, whatever &ndash; adjusting every move
              to make it fit both the student, his partner, and the envisioned fight scenario.  Doing so is the
              only way forms training can ever become the significant martial skill development tool it was intended to be.

                Many contend that forms are little more than prearranged fighting scenarios and that
                no fight is going to happen so prescribed.  They are correct &ndash; on both points.
                In fairness though, isn't that what most self-defense "techniques" are as well: prearranged
                defenses that tacitly assume a&nbsp;specific attack and its defense will go a&nbsp;certain
                way?  Despite the reality that techniques are also "prearranged defenses," few would
                consider eliminating them from their training curriculums!

                Although having trained for just nineteen years, Bruce Lee was a phenomenal practitioner.
                In my book, <i><a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump" title="Martial Arts America: A Western Approach to Eastern Arts">Martial Arts America</a> &ndash;
                A&nbsp;Western Approach to Eastern Arts</i>, I&nbsp;identify Lee as one of the two most
                significant contributors to martial arts in America.  Can any one of us imagine what
                he would have been like and the skills he would have acquired had he lived and trained just
                twenty years more?

                When speaking of "youth" and "younger" students we are not referring to children.
                What we mean is compared to those in their say, sixties, those in their thirties are still
                considered <i>young</i>.
