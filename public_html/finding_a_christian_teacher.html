            <br>Often I&nbsp;am asked for help locating a "Christian" martial arts instructor.  Curiously, during my training,
              not one of my teachers was (at least to my knowledge) a&nbsp;born-again follower of Jesus
              Christ.  I&nbsp;point this out because while it is a definite plus if you find a good teacher who shares your faith,
              it remains for the most part, largely unnecessary.  From personal perspective, the teacher's faith in Christ
              should not be the primary criteria for estimating his ability to teach martial arts, and sadly, experience has shown this
              to be true for any provider of goods or services.

            <p>Consider, for example, former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter.  By his own public admission he is
              a&nbsp;"born again" Christian &mdash; and I&nbsp;do not doubt that at all.  However, by practically any standard,
              he was also an awful president and today still supports the major political party that rejects Godly marriage and sanctity
              of life &mdash; just to name two.

          <td align="justify">
              Lest anyone think I&nbsp;am just picking on the "baby-killer" party, consider President George&nbsp;W. Bush.
              He has openly and without apology shared his faith, and despite all the good things he did to protect our nation and
              grow its economy, his compromises on immigration and education have clearly not measured up &mdash; just to name two.
              My point is that being a Christian does not <i>automatically</i> make anyone a good leader, master, professional,
              expert or craftsmen in anything (including myself).  So where does that leave the Christian who seeks martial
              arts instruction, and who is rightly concerned about the <a href="MAA_11_spiritual_dimensn.html">spiritual influences</a>
              found in many (not <i>all</i>&thinsp;) Asian martial arts?

            <p>While Consumer Reports cannot help here, the mature and discerning Christian can still find quality martial art
              instruction &mdash; devoid of traditional Eastern mysticism &mdash; from any number of martial arts, teachers, and
              schools.  The primary test is simple: <i>As long as you are not required to perform any act or function that God's
              Word and your conscience before Him clearly prohibits, then you can probably train there.</i>
              I&nbsp;say "probably" because there remains one more important test: <i>Your</i>&thinsp; faith.

            <p>Romans 14:23 tells us, <font color="firebrick"><i>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</i></font> That means that if you
              cannot train in a given art or school in clear conscience, then you simply cannot train there.  In other words,
              if there is ANY doubt; if you are unsure that God would approve of what you are doing, then stop.  Do not do that.

            <p>For some, this means they can never train in Asian martial arts.  If they partake in such training, and later
              feel any guilt for so doing, then they have sinned and should cease such training immediately.  I&nbsp;have met
              several sincere believers who felt just that way.  They may have had a bad experience in the past and, like the
              recovering alcoholic who realizes that he cannot come anywhere near alcoholic beverages, they know very well that they
              can never come anywhere near Asian martial arts.  God bless them for so living up to their convictions.

            <p>For those of us fortunate enough to train in schools where the arts are taught completely devoid of Eastern mysticism
              and/or religious influences, we must thank God for such a place, and we <i>must not</i> push our liberty on our
              brothers and sisters who are opposed to such training and, therefore, cannot so participate.

            <p>Now, if you happen to find a good school led by one who is a committed Christian as well, then praise God!
              Consider that a blessing.  But, again, seldom should that be our sole or even biggest reason for selecting
              that school or practically any other secular business, service, profession, or just about anything else.

            <p>On the other side of that same coin, such a reason for NOT selecting a Christian-owned or operated business,
              service, profession, or anything else .&thinsp;.&thinsp;.  such a reason should actually motivate us
              Christians to be even better at all that we do &mdash; what a testimony <b>that</b> would be for&nbsp;Christ.

            <p>We pray this helps.
