            Growing up in Indonesia during World War II, my Dutch-Indonesian kuntao-silat teacher did not enjoy the luxury of training with safety equipment.&nbsp; If a student in his day made a mistake when practicing his technique, it often cost him dearly; he could be scarred for life or, worse, crippled.  While this harsh training environment made fighting art practitioners tougher, it also made for fewer of them.&nbsp;
            To help us today in our quest to understand and apply practical techniques, modern practitioners must take advantage of our own cultural differences, as well as make full use of technological advances not available to previous generations.

            <br>Taking advantage of our own <i>cultural differences</i> means that for one thing we wear <a href="recommended_training_shoes.html">shoes</a> in training.&nbsp; Our primary reasons for this are, first, shoes protect your feet during training (and we definitely step on the feet).&nbsp; Second, if we must fight, it will most likely occur while we are wearing shoes.&nbsp; Since our <i>emphasis is always on the practical</i>, we train as closely as possible to the way we fight.&nbsp; For a detailed explanation why training in shoes is so important, read <i>Barefoot Training</i>&nbsp; in <a href="MAA_6_philo_to_practical.html">Chapter&nbsp;Six</a> of <a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump"><i>Martial Arts America</i></a>, but for now, suffice it to say that if you train for self-protection, then you must train in shoes.

            But wearing <i>shoes</i> in training is just the start.&nbsp; Specialized training equipment, safety gear, video technology and other modern training equipment all help us improve our quickness and timing, stretch our muscles and joints with greater frequency and less chance of injury, and do all this for many more years than was previously possible (<i>Martial Arts America</i>, 1998,20).

            <br>Taking advantage of <i>technological advances not available to previous generations</i>, means first and foremost that in all our classes, seminars, and workshops, <b>groin protection is mandatory for ALL</b> &mdash; no exceptions.&nbsp; <a href="groin_protection.html">Arguments against groin protection</a> abound, but the fact is that good, comfortable groin protection has been available for years, and if you really intend to strike the groin in self-defense, then you must strike it in practice (practice to miss in class and you WILL miss in the street).&nbsp; With that in mind, the following equipment is recommended for the protection they provide as well as their comfort and wearability.
