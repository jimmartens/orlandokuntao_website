              our walk down the martial path we will all find ourselves moving through periods where we can
              no longer rely on what worked for us before.  That head-high kick simply gets harder and
              harder to deliver effectively.  The power in that once-awesome reverse punch seems to
              slip, regardless of how much time we invest in practice.  Decreases in physical agility,
              whether through injury or the inevitable aging process will, as a matter of necessity, force
              us to adjust and alter our training, study, and practice.  How does the lifelong martial
              artist deal with this? <p><a name="fn1_back"></a>Faced with reduced, diminished or decreasing
              physical agility (speed, power, strength, and so on), many cease to train
              altogether.<small><sup><b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b></sup></small> Others seek out
              alternative methods of training.<small><b><sup><a href="#fn1">2</a></b></sup></small>
              Please note that I&nbsp;say "alternative" here with absolutely no hint of settling for second
              best (although many &mdash; myself included &mdash; enter this phase in their journey with just that
              feeling).  The fact is that these alternatives often prove themselves far superior to
              the methods we practiced before.  This is because the methods we followed in our early
              days were, relatively speaking, simpler and easier to assimilate &mdash; which is precisely why
              they are taught first).
            <p>Lacking a depth of experience that comes only with time, beginning practitioners are capable
              of digesting only small amounts of all that the martial arts offer (and believe me, they
              offer far more than most of us realize).  Still, even at that early level, we enjoy what
              we learn, develop skill in it, and perfect that skill to the best of our abilities.
              However, because everyone else in our peer group is practicing and playing (or competing)
              with basically the same tools, there is little incentive to try anything else.  Enter
              injury and aging.

                  Although viewed as rusty, jagged edges of the same cursed double-edged sword, injuries and
                  aging are really our allies, not our enemies.  I&nbsp;admit it, I&nbsp;hate those nagging
                  injuries that keep me from reaching higher levels of physical skill as much as the next person
                  (and I&nbsp;have had my share of them).  I&nbsp;feel the same about aging, and I&nbsp;still
                  fight it tooth and nail (I&nbsp;am definitely not aging gracefully), but I&nbsp;am, at least,
                  at this point in my martial art training, beginning to taste and appreciate lemonade.
                  <p>
                  What do I&nbsp;mean?  Well, there's an expression that goes something like this:
                  "When you're stuck with lemons, you can either put on a sour face, or you can make lemonade."

              Here then, are our lemons: 1)&nbsp;If you train seriously, injuries are inescapable.
              2)&nbsp;If you breathe, aging is inevitable.  Since no one likes a sourpuss (hopefully you
              don't like yourself when you wear one), then you might as well try to make lemonade from your
              lemons.  Let's look at one very old Chinese martial art recipe for lemonade.
              <br>&nbsp;

            <br>Although there are literally hundreds of Chinese martial art systems and styles, all of
              them spring from one of two traditions: Buddhist (more widely recognized as Shaolin) and
              Taoist.  Of the two, the Shaolin family tree has, shall we say, the larger number of
              distinguishable branches, variants, systems or styles.  Divided many times (northern
              and southern, grappling and striking, and so on), Shaolin arts have numerous recognizable
              names, including <i>Praying Mantis, White Crane, Hung Gar, Wing Chun,</i> etc.  Taoist martial
              arts, on the other hand, number only three:  <i>Xing-yi, Ba-gua, and Taijiquan</i>.
            <br>&nbsp;<br><a name="fn3_back"></a>
              Among traditional Taoist martial art practitioners there are those who hold that the best
              course of study for self-defense is to begin with <i>Xing-yi</i>, intern in <i>Ba-gua</i>, and finally
              graduate with an advanced degree in <i>Taijiquan.</i>  Not everyone subscribes to this style-
              or art-switching progression, believing that each art has all the necessary elements and that
              most people end up sticking with their discipline rather than switching with age.
              But even among those who invest themselves in only one of these arts, there often exists a
              similar, albeit less obvious, progression within that art.
            <p>The late Jou Tsung Hwa, a respected and renowned taiji master, believed that taiji is, itself,
              divided into at least three phases.<small><sup><b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b></sup></small>
              He believed that the three major taiji systems, <i>Chen, Yang,</i> and <i>Wu,</i> are actually best taught
              in a progression because they build on and complement one
              another.<small><sup><b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b></sup></small> As he saw it, Chen style
              (the oldest known taiji system and one that bears marked similarities to xing-yi) should be
              learned first, since it is half <i>yang</i> and half <i>yin</i> (half hard, half soft).  Chen should
              be followed with Yang style (the most popular form and the one that most folks recognize as
              taiji) which is 75-percent soft.  Finally, one should take up Wu style, which is
              considered the most internal of the three with the smallest, most subtle movements of the
              major taiji systems.  Similar progressions are likely found in many arts (not just
              Taoist martial arts).
            <p>The progression (from xing-yi to ba-gua to taiji) runs counter to common Western experience
              where taiji (by itself) is most often pursued strictly for its health benefits rather than
              its martial potential.  Unfortunately, this leads to some erroneous conclusions about
              the effectiveness of taiji as a means of self-defense.  That aside, there remains
              something notable about this Taoist progression: it closely parallels and complements the
              practitioner as he grows, ages, and, simultaneously, matures his practice of the arts.
            <p>Before we explore this martial progression, allow me this brief disclaimer.
              I&nbsp;am not expert in these Taoist arts.  My opinions are broad, general, and based
              largely on personal observation, available literature, and personal martial art study and
              experience.  That said, let's begin with a short description of each of art,
              highlighting some of their <i>general</i> characteristics.
              <br>&nbsp;

            <!--<p><img src="images/xing_yi.gif" alt="Xing-yi" width="71" height="25" border="0"> -->
            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Xing-yi</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>The most linear of the three arts, xing-yi frequently has the practitioner advancing in
              a straight line, turning, and advancing again.  Strength is opposed mainly by strength,
              and this style's rapid-fire punches remind us of modern wing chun.  Granted, this is the
              grossest generalization.  There is much that we can say to mitigate and expand on some
              of these impressions, but these are accurate as far as they go and, as such, they are useful
              for this discussion.  Xing-yi, then, is rigorous, conditioning, strengthening, and
              especially effective when one has the speed and strength of youth.
              <br>&nbsp;

            <!-- <p><img src="images/ba_gua.gif" alt="Ba-gua" width="73" height="25" border="0"> -->
            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Ba-gua</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>Technically more precise, sophisticated,and smoother than xing-yi, ba-gua requires &mdash; no
              demands &mdash; less effort and strength of the practitioner to be effective.  (My apologies
              in advance to any xing-yi players whom my words may offend; 'tis not my intention to do
              so.  Many xing-yi practitioners invest their lives in their art and are as formidable
              in their skill as they are polished in their movement.)  Where xing-yi is more linear
              in approach, ba-gua is circular.  Xing-yi and ba-gua are extremely effective fighting
              arts in and of themselves, and many practitioners spend their entire lives studying and
              refining their skills in just one of them.  However, it is when one works through
              xing-yi and progresses well into ba-gua, that his combat effectiveness soars.
              Howard Reid and Michael Croucher, in <i>The Way of the Warrior</i>, quote Master Hung I-hsiang
              as he describes ba-gua:
            <blockquote>
              <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In ba-gua, the emphasis is on tricks and subtle evasive action.
                Unlike xing-yi, it does not require one to face the opponent directly.  In xing-yi,
                1,000 kilos of strength is met with 1,000 kilos.  In ba-gua, one tries to move in
                circles to avoid direct confrontation, thereby permitting one to deflect and overturn
                1,000 kilos of strength with only 100 grams.  Xing-yi is direct and linear, ba-gua
                is indirect and circular.  Tai-chi works in all directions.  (Reid &amp; Croucher, 101)
            </blockquote>

            <br>Taiji represents the <i>cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</i> of the Taoist martial arts.
              As the last step in a progressive training program, it demands still less effort and strength
              on the part of the practitioner, for the physical conditioning and toughening of xing-yi has
              paved the way for the technical excellence developed in ba-gua which, itself, now yields to a
              complete blending with your opponent so perfect that his energy and effort only serve his own
              self-destructive tendencies, practically causing him to injure himself.  (I&nbsp;like to say
              that taiji meets 1,000 kilos of strength with just 10 grammes.)
              <br>&nbsp;

            <br>Armed with a general understanding of xing-yi, ba-gua, and taiji, we can now draw a parallel
              between this traditional Taoist progression and lifelong martial art training and study.
              Besides providing an effective method of self-defense for the practitioner, xing-yi serves to
              condition, toughen, and prepare the younger student (younger meaning less than middle age).
              With youthful vigor and strength, the xing-yi player is more than capable of fighting fire with
              fire &mdash; facing force with force.  But as the practitioner enters middle age, old injuries
              take their toll, and, frankly, strength begins to wane.  This is true for every martial
              artist, no matter what his art of choice.  No amount of additional or rigorous training
              can overcome the injury-imposed limitations or halt the relentless decline.  What were
              once punishing blows and blocks now become painful, even harmful, to the practitioner.
              Techniques that were possible before injury touched your neck, back, or knees are now impractical
              (if not impossible).  Recovery times lengthen dramatically, and decreased stamina makes
              prolonged conflict even less desirable.  This stage is the first point of discouragement,
              and many martial artists simply acquiesce here and cease training altogether.  However,
              this is really unnecessary, and Taoist arts show us how we can adjust.

                <td valign="top" align="justify">
                  Moving into ba-gua, the seasoned xing-yi player learns new methods that enhance his technical
                  skill, allowing him to overcome an adversary using sophisticated, largely circular movements,
                  in place of raw natural speed and strength.  This progression can be applied to whatever
                  martial art one may study.  Challenged once more &mdash; and this is <i>extremely</i> important
                  &mdash; the martial artist finds that there is still more to learn (humans, for the most part, love
                  learning).  Equally important, the need for self-defense is still satisfied (there is no
                  settling for second best here).  Now, however, the training (and fighting) progresses without
                  the collateral damage to yourself.  All of this is unthinkable, if not impossible, for the
                  younger practitioner, for he has neither developed sufficiently in the basics, nor does he possess
                  the necessary wisdom of years to see the need to try something else.

            <p>The likes of Billy Blanks and his Tae&nbsp;Bo cardio fitness program &mdash; strong and in great
              shape almost despite their years &mdash; will likely not pursue different avenues until pain
              overrules any gain received from their current training methods.  But even the seasoned
              practitioner cannot remain forever in this "middle-age" category, for time marches on.
              This brings the Taoist practitioner to taijiquan &mdash; <i>the grand ultimate fist.</i>

            <p>In advanced years (those beyond middle age), even hard-style practitioners find their arts'
              focus and training methods "softening."  Whether by conscious decision or subconscious
              evolution, eventually the practitioner's body resists repeated "hard" training.  For
              example, those who have witnessed the development of tang&nbsp;soo&nbsp;do from its early
              years to the present day tell us that the material and methods that were part of the founder's
              curriculum have changed with every decade of his life, softening considerably in later
              years.  In this vein, taiji offers the grand, ultimate destination in the Taoist
              progression for the senior, experienced practitioner.  Although less virile in
              appearance, the taiji master whose training has spanned xing-yi, ba-gua, and taijiquan will
              seldom be challenged successfully.  He remains a formidable player, largely because his
              skill is based on a <i>natural</i> progression <i>and</i> on the years of experience that
              such a progression <i>demands</i>.
            <br>&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Lifelong Study</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>Even if you do not study Taoist martial arts (and most who study martial arts for
              self-defense in the United States do not), such a progression is still possible.
              You see, the specific arts we study are much less important than their training philosophy,
              methods, and principles of combat.  You can substitute any number of hard style arts
              for xing-yi, for instance.  Likewise, there are many arts from China and Southeast
              Asia that can stand in quite nicely for ba-gua.  What is important here is our
              willingness to <i>embrace</i> the changes forced on us by injury and aging, not merely
              accept their consequences.  If that means switching arts to learn new principles,
              then do it (moving from xing-yi to ba-gua is no less significant a change).  As an
              example, I&nbsp;have a good friend, Chip Van Wert, who trained in Wado-ryu karate, holds
              a black belt in aikido, and now studies Chen-style taiji.
            <p>I&nbsp;said at the start that seeking "alternative" methods of training is not settling
              for second best, and that injury and aging need not be our enemies and can actually be our
              allies.  I&nbsp;mean that.  Believe it or not, at 60+, my technique is much, much
              more effective now than it was when I&nbsp;was younger and physically stronger.
              Obviously, 40-plus years of dedicated training has a lot to do with this, but, more
              importantly, my physical strength no longer <i>hampers</i> my ability to relax through
              my movement &mdash; and relaxation is the key that unlocks speed and power.  Despite not
              being as strong as I&nbsp;was decades ago, I&nbsp;am, nevertheless, significantly
              faster.  I&nbsp;hit harder than ever, but without the effort AND without the damage
              to myself.  I&nbsp;would never have realized such a level of improvement had my body
              remained whole and my strength as it was 30 years ago.  The transition I&nbsp;experienced
              was also possible because the arts I&nbsp;study are completely amenable to "softer" execution
              of their movements and techniques.  In fact, beyond beginner level, every technique and
              principle of movement in the arts I&nbsp;study actually <i>improves</i> in efficiency when
              executed with less strength.  And therein lies a problem.  How do you train to use
              "less strength" in an endeavor that may someday be needed to save your life?  Less
              strength and relaxed execution seem counterintuitive when when you're learning potentially
              life-saving skills.

                  <br>There is no easy answer to the question "How do you train to use 'less strength' in
                  an endeavor that may someday be needed to save your life?" (but then, nothing that is worth
                  anything is ever easy).  I&nbsp;guess the best advise is to keep reminding yourself,
                  "Train smarter, not harder."  Listen to your body.  As martial artists, we're
                  supposed to be in tune with our bodies.  OK then, <i>listen</i>.  When you find
                  that meeting 1,000 pounds of force with 1,000 pounds begins getting harder and harder and
                  the effort to do so greater and greater, then step back and reevaluate your training.
                  If your art's answer is to train still harder, then seriously consider looking elsewhere.
                  I&nbsp;have many tae kwon do friends, for example, who, after decades in that art, now augment
                  their training with taiji (not just for health, mind you, although their taiji training is
                  clearly beneficial there, but for continued growth and improvement in their martial skills).

              For some of us, our own discipline and determination prevent our looking elsewhere.
              We try harder (not smarter) until something breaks.  Only then do we look elsewhere.
              I&nbsp;know.  (Been there; done that.)  A bad back and subsequent operation,
              for example, forced me to lower my kicking (Why else would I?  I&nbsp;was a good
              kicker).  But instead of settling for less, I&nbsp;found that kicking low (for example,
              <a href="offensive_back_kick.html">kicking the legs</a>) was not only a much more effective method
              defense in a fight, but much more challenging to learn to do correctly and effectively than I'd
              previously thought.  Moreover, as arthritis made punching "hard" targets more painful, my
              recognition of the greater vulnerability of other targets, such as joints and limbs, soared.
              Likewise, my appreciation for my other weapons (knees, elbows, and open hands) grew significantly.
              Today, my impact, speed, and precision (accurately striking the target) is much, much better than it ever
              was when I&nbsp;was younger &mdash; and I&nbsp;gained all of that without sacrificing any ability to defend
              myself.

              age and experience bring.  Whether you see the necessary perspective as fortunate or
              unfortunate may foretell how you, as a martial artist, will continue to grow in the arts as
              your injury toll and chronological age increase and your physical abilities register a

                  Of those pursuing alternative training methods, the most successful are
                  those whose motivation for training and study is either self-defense or cultural pursuit
                  (martial ways).  Obviously, self-defense is a much stronger motivator than training
                  for sport.  Martial arts also offer many more venues than do sport.  Likewise,
                  martial ways offer a great number of venues for continued study, although without the
                  self-defense focus.

                  | Reference: 19990413 e-mail
                  |
                  | As you may remember, I also trained in both (still do), under two
                  | superlative instructors. Unfortunately, Master Jou (my Taji master)
                  | recently passed on as I had let you all know. You had mentioned that
                  | there used to be the progression from Xing-I to Bagua to Taji, and in
                  | that you were absolutely correct. Soft martial arts were never meant to
                  | be taught without a 'hard' foundation. However, no one today is willing
                  | to put in the 10 years "hard time" to really learn the progression in the
                  | correct manner.
                  |
                  | Taiji without a hard style background is like that parable from the Bible
                  | where one man builds his house upon sand, and another upon a rock. The
                  | man who built his house upon the sand lost it in the first storm whereas
                  | the one who built his on stone stood firm.
                  |
                  | When I first started training with Master Jou, I was concerned that my
                  | hard style background would hinder my learning Taiji. He scoffed and told
                  | me that I was absolutely doing the RIGHT thing. After watching me work,
                  | he told me that right now I was a tiger, but once I learned Taiji and
                  | could apply it's principles, I would become a tiger with wings!
                  |
                  | As a matter of fact, Master Jou even thought that Taijii was divided into
                  | three phases and the three major systems, Chen, Yang, and Wu, were
                  | actually best taught in a progression, that they actually built upon and
                  | complimented one another. He stated that the Chen style (the oldest known
                  | Taiji system which is actually very similar to Xing-I) should be learned
                  | first since it is half Yang and half Yin (1/2 hard, 1/2 soft). Then comes
                  | the Yang system (the most popular form that most folks know of as Taiji)
                  | which is 75% soft. Lastly comes Wu style which is considered the most
                  | internal with the smallest, most subtle movements of the three major
                  | systems.
                  |
                  | Master Jou would say that Chen was like cash, you can see just what your
                  | getting. Yang was like writing a check. You can't see the money, but it's
                  | there. Wu was electronic funds transfer. The transaction takes place, but
                  | you never see it.

                  There are those who hold that hold that taiji consists of four or even
                  five major styles.  Chronologically listed from oldest to youngest they are: Chen style,
                  developed in the 1670s by Chen Wangting; Yang style, created by Yang Luchan (1799-1872);
                  Wu style created by Wu Yuxiang (1812-1880); Hoa style &mdash; Wu style as passed from Wu Yuxiang
                  to and developed by Hoa Weizheng (1849-1920); and Sun style (the youngest of the major
                  styles created by Sun Lu-tang (1861-1932).  <i>Inside Kung-Fu</i>, Dr.&nbsp;Paul Lam,
