              <p>At last someone finally did a DVD on principles and concepts instead of a bunch methods to deal with specific
                attacks the material is clearly explained sometimes using analogys with humor.&nbsp; And letting the student know
                that in understanding the all important concepts they can be free to devise an almost endless arsenal of effective
                responses to unorthodox attacks.&nbsp; You find yourself grafting the principles onto your existing art making it
                more brutal.&nbsp; This DVD is worth its weight in gold.&nbsp;

              <p><b>Thank You For Your Videos</b>
              <p>I purchased your&nbsp; <i>Fighting Arts of Indonesia,</i>&nbsp; <i>Reflex Action</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp;
                <i>Fighting Forms of Kuntao-Silat</i>&nbsp; videos and I must say these videos are real gems.&nbsp;
                I've been involved in Martial Arts since 8 years of age and am now 61 &ndash; I've studied Judo,
                Shotokan, Taijiquan, Xingyiquan and earned Shodan rank in American Kenpo, and your videos are so
                refreshing&nbsp; I felt I should tell you.
              <p>Thanks a million,

              <p>Professor Orlando's DVD is superb. The way he presents his teachings is very clear, practical and with a
                little humor.&nbsp; As he says, you need to have fun when working on something serious.&nbsp; Techniques are
                solid and easy to learn when dedication is applied.&nbsp; You can add these as additional tools to your
                practice.&nbsp; I have bought other DVD sets recorded by professor Orlando and my plan is to get them all
                for my DVD library.&nbsp; Great resource!<br>&nbsp;

              <p><b>Now we're talking!!!!</b>
              <br>This is one of my favorite Silat training videos today.&nbsp; Even though it is already over 10 years
              old, I still watch it time and again as Bob's method of teacking appeals to me greatly and his attention
              to detail is truly spectacular.&nbsp; Just to add, you'll want to search for his other 3 videos as they
              expand upon what was said here.&nbsp; Overall, Bob&nbsp;Orlando's videos represent the standard for what
              all martial arts training videos should be.&nbsp; The only negative I can give is that Bob doesn't have
              anymore videos for me to buy!!!<br>&nbsp;

              <p>Do not get caught up with trying to learn hundreds of techniques.&nbsp; In reality, the basics are all that

              Fundamentals</i>.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando is a master teacher and you will not be disappointed with the way
              he explains concepts and demonstrates drills that really help you become "ready for action."<br>&nbsp;

              <br>August 2002
              <p>A very good video describing many of the core concepts of Indonesian fighting systems.&nbsp; One of the
              things that came out from early training in Peaceful Fight was that the "natural" way of moving the lower
              body (i.e. feet/legs) is significantly more unpleasant than what most arts teach.&nbsp; This Indonesian
              arts video is the only one to date (Aug. 2002) that has ever detailed a formalized stepping method that
              mimics this natural motion.&nbsp; Add to this that all of the techniques shown were very effective and
              well explained and this is a video that everyone should see (regardless of there you are practicing an
              Indonesian art or not).<br>&nbsp;

              <br>April 13, 1999
              <p>A couple of days ago I finally received my copy of Bob Orlando's video, "<i>Fighting Arts of Indonesia</i>."
              I've viewed it several times and feel I can pass on some impressions.
              <p>The overall quality of the video is very good.&nbsp; The picture quality and the sound are fine.&nbsp;
              The taping was done in a studio setting, not out of doors or anywhere where there would have been extraneous
              sounds or movement from the background.&nbsp; Bob presents his material articulately, and in a very organized
              manner.&nbsp; As he demonstrates technique, he positions himself and his partners so the technique can be
              viewed from several angles, both at full speed, and then more slowly with a breakdown and explanation of the
              technique and application.<p>I always find it both pleasing and exciting when I hear another Martial Arts
              practitioner espousing the same philosophy I've developed on training and teaching the Martial Arts (it
              makes me feel as if after 35 years of practicing I may finally have gotten a clue!).&nbsp; The main concept
              that Bob relates is that technique is secondary to it's underlying principles both of movement and strategy.

 <!--  1 --><p><b>Triumph Magazine</b>
              <br>Volume VI, Issue 6 (October, 1997)
              <br><i>Video Review</i> by Debbie Field,&nbsp; <b>Warrior Martial Arts Supply</b>,&nbsp; Denver, Colorado
              <p>&quot;Before reviewing Bob Orlando's new martial arts video titled <i>Fighting Arts of Indonesia: Combat
              Secrets of Silat and Kuntao</i>, I inquired as to what it covered and was told it followed his recent book
              <i>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</i>.&nbsp; So, off I went to the bookstore to get the book to read before
              I saw the video.<p>A few words about the book.&nbsp; It costs $40, which I consider pretty steep, but if
              you're interested in combat application, this is quality material and you'll get much more than your forty
              dollars worth of information out of it.&nbsp; The book is multi-faceted in that Orlando gives some historical
              background on silat and kuntao as well as the personal history of his instructor, Willem de&nbsp;Thouars; he
              presents information in a concise, logical format; and entertains with humor that is often aimed at himself.&nbsp;
              It is something like a cookbook for combat arts--it has some great recipes.
              <p>Books are one of the most difficult ways to teach martial arts.&nbsp; Orlando presents Indonesian fighting
              principles in depth.&nbsp; The only shortcoming of the book is the first rate pictures of the applications
              (of which there are hundreds).&nbsp; Actually, the shortcoming is of the human brain which sometimes cannot
              connect the dots from picture to picture.
