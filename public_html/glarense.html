              fine martial arts have been preserved through time.
              Some were preserved because they became widely known and
              popular. Other, more obscure arts were preserved only
              through the unbending iron will of practitioners
              determined not to let them die (often despite personal
              and governmental opposition, threats, prohibitions,
              prison sentences, and even death). One such art,
              garrote, survives in South America, specifically in
              Venezuela, largely through music.

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; During festivals honoring St. Anthony,
              inhabitants of the Venezulan state of Lara gather in
              the streets of Barquisimeto and dance the Tamunange.
              A part of this dance is called <i>La Batalla</i> (the
              battle), and in it <i>garroteros</i> (garrote players)
              play to the music--not with musical instruments, but
              with their <i>garrotes</i>, or sticks. Some just
              clash sticks, but others literally do battle, fighting it
              out to test and prove their skill.<br>&nbsp;

            <h3>Origins</h3>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the origins of garrote Larense
              are shrouded in mystery, it is no coincidence that it
              shares a number of Spanish terms in common with many
              Filipino arts. For example, some Filipino old-timers
              still use the word <i>garrote</i> for stick.
              Much like the Philippines, Spanish-speaking Venezuela was
              part of the Spanish empire for more than 300 years.
              Spain, you should know, was the source of some of the finest
              fencers in the world. It was only natural, then, that
              the Venezuelan peasants would copy, practice, and even
              improve on some of the swordsmanship they were privileged
              to observe. Despite the fact that lowly peasants
              could not afford swords, they were, nonetheless, skilled
              with their machetes--tools they used every day, and
              sometimes on Saturday nights when someone had too much to
              drink and tempers flared or when defending the honor of
              a beautiful woman.

            <h3>The Tradition Endures: Garrote Today</h3>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; As if by magic, masters of garrote seem
              to know their opponent's next move.  This "magic" is
              actually the result of precise footwork, body angulation,
              and manipulation of the stick, all of which serve to limit
              the opponent's options.  The master <i>garrotero</i>
              guides the opponent toward predictable responses by
              offering him fewer opportunities for attack.  Moreover,
              the <i>garrotero</i> actually baits his opponent
              practically forcing him to attack the openings the
              <i>garrotero</i> himself selects, thereby making the
              attack even easier to counter.  So how do these masters
              reach such high levels of skill?  Through hard, often
              painful training.<br>&nbsp;

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Garrote training is conducted without
              protective gear or padded sticks (which explains a lot of
              the "intensity" inherent in this art). The old
              masters believed that pain was the best teacher, and while
              some criticize this approach, it is amazing to see how an
              apparently slow or sluggish student reacts very quickly
              after the first couple of "touches." There is
              something eye-opening, even to the otherwise seasoned
              martial artist, about closing the gap and having to slip
              a long hard stick (made from branches of the lemon tree)
              that can easily be manipulated with a little hand movement,
              mainly the wrist.

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Another of the characteristics that tie
              garrote to Filipino arts is the fact that whatever one
              learns with the stick can be, with minor adjustments,
              adapted to the machete (<i>bolo</i>), knife, or empty
              hand.  Moreover, garrote training develops practitioners
              who are as much at ease with the weapon in their left hand
              as they are with it in their right.  This makes the
              <i>garrotero</i> a highly unpredictable and, therefore,
              formidable fighter.<a name="endnote_1_back"></a>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Because there is no way to know how an
              opponent will attack in real life, once the garrote
              student has learned the basics, he further develops and
              hones his skills through sparring, where he moves and
              counters using the system's highly dynamic footwork, fluid
              body angulation, deflection, evasion, hand switching, and
              tremendous power generated by body torque.  The intensity
              of training in garrote develops, as you might expect,
              lightning reflexes, but it also develops a calm demeanor
              and the ability to keep one's cool in every
              situation.<br>&nbsp;

            <h3>The Basics</h3>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first thing the student learns is
              not how to strike someone, as you might expect, but the
              <i>cuadro</i>, or cross pattern.<a href="#endnote_1"
              onMouseOver="window.status='To reference one';return
              true;"><sup><b>1</b></sup></a>&nbsp; <i>Cuadro</i> is
              a footwork pattern the student must fix in his mind
              throughout his training. Using this simple pattern,
              the student learns to move in ways that not only help
              him avoid the attacking baton, but also position him to
              deliver a powerful counterstrike. From there he
              graduates to more lethal weapons: knives and machetes.

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; As in Filipino fighting arts, garrote
              strikes come from practically anywhere. Factor
              in the rapid and frequent hand switching with the weapon,
              and garrote can seem a bit overwhelming. For this
              reason, the students are first taught four basic strikes:
              <i>franco, rev&egrave;s, pulla,</i> and<i> barre
              campo.</i> Those four strikes are illustrated below
              using the <i>cuadro</i>.

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the photographs that follow, the
              practitioners are using machetes.  This is not recommended
              for beginners, but here our purpose is to show you how you
              must mentally extend your practice beyond the stick.
              Doing so opens your eyes to the seriousness with which
              this art is practiced as well as the countless other
              possibilities that the art of garrote Larense holds.  In
              observing combatants with real machetes in hand, it is
              easy to focus on the weapon and completely miss the
              footwork, which plays a critical role in garrote.
              Unfortunately, time prohibits even a cursory examination
              of the subtleties involved here, but as you study the four
              sequences that follow, visualize a simple cross on the
              floor and see how the footwork of the players outlines
              each movement's quarter in the <i>cuadro</i>.  Once a
              student learns the basic strikes and the footwork
              <i>cuadro</i>, he begins to develop other attributes
              through controlled strikes as he picks up the pace in
              practice with his seniors.<br>&nbsp;

            <h4>Franco</h4>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Franco</i> means <i>open</i>. You
              can see the openness in Figure 1 where the
              <i>garroteros</i> are squared off in the classical ready
              position.  It is "open" because there is nothing between
              the combatants--everything is open.  The action begins in
              Figure 2 as the attacker (on the right) begins his assault
              with a downward vertical forehand strike.  In almost
              serpentine undulation, the defender slips the attack by
              moving first his head, then his shoulder, and lastly the
              rest of his body out of harm's way (figs. 2 and 3).  In
              such a life-and-death struggle, simple avoidance is likely
              insufficient to deter the attacker, so in Figure 4, the
              defender begins his counterattack.

            </center>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; When training this basic sequence,
              the players would not simply stop here but would
              continue by switching roles and resuming the flow depicted
              in Figures 1, 2, 3, and so forth.&nbsp; This allows both
              players to flow continuously back and forth, gaining many
              repetitions in what becomes a fluid and highly dynamic
              training method.<br>&nbsp;

            <h4>Rev&egrave;s</h4>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In this sequence, the <i>garroteros</i>
              are already in motion.  The assailant (on the left)
              attacks his opponent with a downward descending right
              backhand strike known as <i>rev&egrave;s</i>, or reverse
              (fig. 1).  In this case, the attacker's blow comes while
              the defender's weapon is in his right hand, and although
              this attack is directed to the defender's head or
              shoulders, it might just as well be directed toward a
              limb.  Notice that in Figure 1, the defender switches his
              weapon from his right to his left hand.
              (<i>Garroteros</i> train for equal dexterity.)  As the
              defender switches the weapon, he simultaneously slips
              inside his opponent's attacking line (fig. 2), again
              undulating to move his head, shoulders, limb, and finally
              his body away from the deadly attack.  (Reminiscent of
              baguazhang, this undulation is a characteristic trait of
              garrote.)  With his weapon now firmly in his left hand and
              his body momentarily out of danger, the defender
              counterattacks (fig. 3).

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; As you study these sequences, bear in mind
              that they are much, much more than the simple techniques
              you see here. As in any martial art, it is important
              to look beyond the technique, beyond the attack and
              counterattack. It is also important to look beyond
              the obvious targets (i.e., the head and torso) to
              alternative but equally disabling marks. Moreover,
              you must look at how these flows can be combined.
              Imagine after defending against <i>franco</i>, switching
              the weapon from your right to your left hand, then
              pressing your counterattack with a left-handed
              <i>rev&egrave;s</i>.<br>&nbsp;

            <h4>Pulla</h4>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Continuing our visualization, it is
              easy to see a thrusting move as a quick follow-up to our
              initial <i>rev&egrave;s</i> counterattack (above).
              That thrust is called <i>pulla</i>.

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Pulla</i> (pronounced poo-ya) is an

              expression used in Venezuela that means "to pinch," as if
              to pinch someone with a needle--in this case, a very large
              needle.; As you can see, <i>pulla</i> is a basic thrust
              much like the Filipino number 5 line, only in this
              sequence, the <i>pulla</i> attack steps all the way
              through (fig. 1)--like a lunge.  Using primarily the blade
              to deflect his opponent's weapon, the defender
              simultaneously weaves himself out of the way of the
              onrushing attack (fig. 2).  If possible, the defender also
              checks his assailant's hand.  Now out of harm's way, the
              defender is in a position to counter with a thrust of his
              own (fig. 3).

              </center>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Could the defender have countered with
              something other than <i>pulla</i> here?  Absolutely.  As
              a matter of fact, <i>garroteros</i> are trained to very
              quickly recognize any number of attacks and react with any
              of several counters.  An excellent counter to <i>pulla</i>
              is our next movement, <i>barre campo</i>.<br>&nbsp;

            <h4>Barre Campo</h4>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Barre campo</i> means "to clear the
              field," and this sweeping attack does just that.
              Figure 1 begins with the <i>garroteros</i> once again in
              the classical ready position (OK, it's a Latin machismo
              thing <img src="images/face_smiley.gif" alt="Smiley
              face">).&nbsp; In what looks at first to be a withdrawal,
              the assailant's right hand falls back. But instead
              of backing away, the attacker returns with a rising right
              backhand slash designed to split the defender from femur
              to clavicle (fig. 2). In a characteristic garrote
              move, the defender avoids the attack while simultaneously
              switching his weapon from his right to his left
              hand. With his weapon now in his left land, the
              defender simultaneously deflects the rising attack as he
              completes his own escape (fig. 3). Finally, in a move
              that both throws his opponent off balance and sets up his
              own counterattack, the defender slams a stiff right palm
              into his attacker's face (fig. 4). No counterattack
              is shown here because it should be obvious by now that
              from his present position, the defender can execute
              practically any of the movements discussed, from
              <i>franco</i> or <i>pulla</i> to a hand switch into
              <i>rev&egrave;s</i> or a <i>barre campo</i> of his
              own.<br>&nbsp;

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest you think the hand switching of
              garrote is either too slow or too complicated for use in
              actual combat, rest assured this is not the case.
              With practice, hand switches become as automatic as
              breathing, and they are deceptively wicked in the hands
              of a seasoned <i>garrotero</i>.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past, some of the old masters
              routinely played with only a handful of strikes, though
              they surely knew many more.  However, they were so adept
              with the ones they showed that contendersrarely came
              forward to challenge them.  One such master used to say,
              "I never carry a stick or a machete--my enemy does.  I
              will use his."  If his enemy brought no weapon, then the
              master might even remove one of his own sandals and
              proceed to whip his hapless foe with that.  Such was the
