<p><b>This Book was Just What I Needed</b><br><font color="blue">Great job. I learned a lot from the book, and it was good to receive both confirmation and development on things I was thinking about, myself.&nbsp; I also harbor a dream of becoming a part time instructor, myself, and your book contained lots of useful things to think about concerning how I would want to structure my own martial arts school if that ever becomes a reality.</font>
<p>What's more, <i>Martial Arts America</i> actually changed my mind about some vital issues.&nbsp; I, too, had often clamored for the preservation of the 'traditional' methods of martial arts.&nbsp; After going over the book's arguments, I realize that does not make a lot of sense unless someone is interested in learning martial arts solely for the sake of learning tradition.&nbsp; I thought the analogy to the army fighting with 'battle proven' tactics developed in the Spanish-American war was especially apt.&nbsp; The quote from Yip Man was also beneficial; if there was ever a community of martial artists being ripped apart by the struggle between traditionalists and progressives, it is the Wing Chun community.
<p>I also appreciated your thoughts on <a href="chi_definition.html" target="main_display_area">chi</a>. &nbsp;They helped explain its mythic roots as well as give some 'de-mystified' options.</font></td></tr></table>
