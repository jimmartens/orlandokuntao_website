<p><p><b>Review By Arthur C. Andersen<br>Principle Instructor, Shoku Ryu Bugei</b><br>Londonville, Ohio<br>April, 1999
<p>Bob Orlando has organized a very concise package of physical principles indicative of martial movement as practiced by and imparted from his instructor, Willem de&nbsp;Thouars.  Self-admittedly, he has not tried to offer a comprehensive history of Indonesian martial arts, but instead, gives an interested practitioner colorfully detailed representations of blocking, striking, and balance-disrupting techniques which comprise the repertoire of Mr. Orlando's interpretation of Indonesian fighting fundamentals.
<p>Formatted in a progressive fashion, the Introduction and the first chapter give the reader several specific academic guidelines for developing an open-minded perspective for pursuing general mastery during practice.  Mr. Orlando proceeds to detail within chapters 2 through 7, one specific physical principle per chapter.  The concepts include Adhesion, Whiplash, Gyroscopic Rotation, Shearing, Seating, and Leg Maneuvers, respectively.
<p>Obviously, Mr. Orlando has chosen to use common terms other than traditional Indonesian expressions.  This accurately describes the principle's essential nature to an interested practitioner unfamiliar with either the Indonesian language or the culture's martial heritage.  The terms capture the key physical attribute of each specific principle without any confusing, foreign expressions a novice enthusiast might encounter.
<p>Numerous, sequential black and white photographs provide thorough back-up to the text written, explaining the physical ideal of Mr. Orlando's foundation of movement.  Together, the photographs and text allow the reader to gain a clear understanding of the book's goal of explaining key physical principles of movement indicative of success in any martial discipline and specific to Mr. Orlando's interpretation of Willem de&nbsp;Thouars' Kuntao Silat.
<p>The following Chapter 8, <i>Peanut Brittle</i>, takes the independent principles covered in the previous 6 chapters and guides the reader toward amalgamating those previously explained concepts into usable strategies.  From here, the reader might gain a better comprehension of the necessity for developing the flow of movement within the parameters of a well-planned conditioning protocol.
<p>The books concluding chapters 9 through 14 pertain to some of the more traditional aspects of the martial arts as tempered from an Indonesian forge.  Such topics, in random order, include the classic argument of Kuntao vs.  Silat, the complexities of past, present and future social responsibilities contained in the issues of using force in "self-defense" situations, the use of forms-training or <i>Jurus</i>, character development through martial practice, and a brief synopsis of <i>Kun Lun Pai</i>, the primary discipline Willem de&nbsp;Thouars has organized.
<p>Mr. Orlando, through Paladin Press of Boulder, Colorado, has given the martial arts library a well-written, easy to follow and neatly illustrated paperback.  It presents a thorough examination of his own understanding of the physical, mental, and spiritual fighting principles which he has discovered to be fundamental to the martial disciplines he has experienced from working with Mr. de&nbsp;Thouars and Mr. de&nbsp;Thouars' senior student.
