            <p><b>Review by <a href="http://www.WimDemeere.com" target="blank_">Wim&nbsp;Demeere</a></b><br>October 5, 2001.
            <p>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals covered principles of Indonesian arts, this one is highly focused on the US.&nbsp; It is also not book about techniques, but more a critical look on martial arts, traditions and customs.&nbsp; Bob evaluates them and spares no sacred cow.
            <p>The book starts with a foreword by Robert Pickett and some acknowledgments.&nbsp; The following introduction explains the purpose of the book: Examining the Eastern martial art practices and philosophies but also comparing their use to the needs of the average American practitioner.
            <p>Chapter one deal with a pertinent question: Why study martial arts?&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando explains the different types of focus the arts have and how they are part of a natural cycle of evolution and devolution.
            <p>Preserving ancient arts, looks at the dangers and value of preserving a martial art exactly as one has received it.&nbsp; Where scores of practitioners claim to teach the exact same thing as the founder did, we should stop and think.&nbsp; Even if the founder died many centuries ago, they claim nothing has been lost throughout time.&nbsp; I always found this to be a strange train of taught and have some more personal opinions on this topic right here.
            <p>The next chapter deals with the claim of "Combat proven" systems.&nbsp; You can read any given martial arts magazine and read an advertisement that states just that.&nbsp; Bob makes the excellent point that culture, environment and other factors have to be taken into consideration before "combat proven" is in fact beneficial to a system.
            <p>Next is a look at traditions that are commonplace in the martial arts world.&nbsp; Some of the ones evaluated are using a foreign language while teaching, bowing and more.
            <p>From philosophical to practical, looks at ways to increase the effectiveness of martial arts training.&nbsp; From traditional blocking to barefoot training, the author takes a critical look at them and offers some alternatives.
            <p>Kata -- Forms training.&nbsp; Here we tread on almost sacred ground for some people.&nbsp; The discussion on the value of forms has been raging for decades and will probably go on forever.&nbsp; Bob discusses the functions of forms, the different types and how they can remain valuable through time.
            <p>Sport Karate tackles the subject of martial arts competitions and more specifically "fighting competitions".&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando considers point fighting, full contact and "no rules" contests.&nbsp; He discusses the benefits and drawbacks to both the individual and the martial arts world as a whole.
            <p>Women in martial arts is about the way gender differences influence practice.&nbsp; Despite some claims, women in general are physically not equal to men in general.&nbsp; This does not mean they are inferior in any way, just different.&nbsp; Some topics covered are:  women and self defense, destructive mind sets, mixed gender training and protective gear.
            <p>Another hot topic is about "Chi".&nbsp; Bob explains his point of view by first classifying the different types of martial arts and how mysticism influences them.&nbsp; He cites several examples of people performing cheap circus trick and attributing them to "chi".&nbsp; As a counterweight to this nonsense, he gives his own explanation of the concept and demonstrates it within a technique.
            <p>Next is the spiritual side of the arts.&nbsp; Many people claim that without an understanding of this aspect, one cannot achieve a high level of skill.&nbsp; The author points out the flaws in this logic and speaks of cultural differences, the focus of each individual, meditation, religion and morality
            <p>Now, commercialism and it's influence on the arts are put under close scrutiny.&nbsp; With the rising numbers of "Mc Dojo's", "world champions" and "Great-grand-ultra-mega-masters", matters have only gotten more complicated.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando looks at the value of all these titles and what a black belt is all about.
            <p>The last chapter discusses what quality instruction should look like.&nbsp; There are some tips on questions to ask before enrolling in a school, considering it's size and affiliation, tuition, contracts and teacher motivation.
            <p>The book ends with a conclusion, references and some info on the author.
            <p><b>Interest:</b>&nbsp; This book is in many ways a close look at a lot of what is wrong with martial arts in America, but it applies to most western countries too.&nbsp;
            <font color="blue">
              The idea is not to jam the author's opinion down your throat or any other form of indoctrination.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Orlando uses logic and sound reasoning to explain his points of view, but his ultimate goal is to get your mind in gear and think.&nbsp; Then think some more.
              <br>&nbsp;<br>
              Whether you agree with him or not is completely irrelevant.&nbsp; The fact that you reconsider your original opinion and perhaps gain a greater understanding of your art, is.&nbsp; Before you think the author spends his ink bashing on traditional styles, this isn't the case.&nbsp; He seems to make an effort to find something positive and valuable in each case.&nbsp; Sometimes this is possible, other times not.
              <br>&nbsp;<br>
              If you are new to the arts and sometimes feel a nagging doubt that what your teacher does/says, might not be the best thing for your martial study, read this book.&nbsp; You might just conclude you were right...or not.&nbsp; If you have been studying for a long time, read it too.&nbsp; There just might be some things in the book that make you think again about topics you formed an opinion on a long time ago.&nbsp; At any rate, I highly recommend this book.
            </font>
            <p><b>Quality:</b>&nbsp; The lay out is well done and the drawings/pictures are clear.&nbsp; The notes are neatly organized per chapter which makes looking them up easy.&nbsp; Good work.
