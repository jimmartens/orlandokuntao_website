            <br>Volume 6, Number 2, June, 1997
            <p>Media Review - by James Wilson, L.Ac.,
            <br>New England School of Acupuncture.
            <p>&quot;The fighting arts of the Indonesian archipelago were never meant for sport&quot; opens the back cover depiction of Bob Orlando's examination of that nation's martial legacy, <i>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals: The Brutal Arts of the Archipelago</i>.&nbsp; Orlando, a veteran of several martial styles admirably illustrates for the reader this fundamental difference between the Indonesian manner of self-defense -- a relative newcomer to the American martial arts scene -- and the plethora of &quot;refined&quot health and/or competition oriented styles imported to our shores in previous decades from Korea, Japan, and China.&nbsp; &quot;An eclectic mixture of the islands' countless styles of pencak silat as well as Chinese kuntao,&quot Orlando's introduction continues, &quot;[Indonesian fighting arts] arose out of necessity throughout a history marked by violent cultural clashes and oppressive foreign occupations.&quot
            <p>As if to emphasize this point, even as I&nbsp;read Mr.&nbsp;Orlando's book, I&nbsp;received an e-mail message from a relative in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, detailing that nation's latest concern: a prominent government minister with close ties to the President has been accused of paying gangs of impoverished youth to burn churches, Chinese homes, and Chinese-owned businesses in an attempt to create the appearance of an Islamic revolt, possible pretense for shutting down the moderate Islamic opposition party prior to national elections later this year.&nbsp; In a land where neither police nor ordinary citizens typically have recourse to firearms, and covert military objectives are for political reasons meted out by non-military personnel posing as unorganized vandals and vigilantes, martial arts can unfortunately still be applied with their original intent, in situations and with a degree of severity rarely presented or appropriate in the West.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why, despite the author's apologies to the contrary, the techniques illustrated in <i>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</i> -- the combined teachings of several Dutch-Indonesian practitioners, primarily Willem de&nbsp;Thouars, all of whom have lived in the United States for several decades -- continue to accurately mirror the forms I&nbsp;see practiced in those islands today, whether in the capital or in remote mountain villages.
            <p><font color="blue">Orlando writes that his intent is not &quot;a detailing [of] the history, culture, or many fighting systems of Indonesia ..., [but] is intended primarily for the martial art student of any rank whose main reason for training and study is effective self-defense&quot;; to this end he has succeeded marvelously.&nbsp; The author accurately portrays the use of a wide variety of Indonesian strikes and stances, effectively demonstrating their differences with other fighting styles, the principles behind their actions, and their use in combat situations.&nbsp; His own sometimes creative terminology -- my personal favorite being &quot;gyroscopic rotation&quot -- actually enhances the student's understanding than if the author had attempted to translate those actions described directly from the Indonesian.&nbsp; Similarly, <i>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</i> is clearly illustrated, with just the right number of photographs and graphics accompanied by clear, concise captions.</font> &nbsp;In this respect, many martial arts authors should consider Orlando's work exemplary.&nbsp; Indeed, my only criticism is when the author violates his initial statement of purpose and does foray into the areas of history and culture:  taught by Dutch-Indonesians and not being personally familiar with those islands, he over emphasizes the Dutch contribution to the study of pencak silat, and has a tendency to wax nostalgic about the colonial era in ways Indonesians to whom I showed the book found either ludicrous or offensive.&nbsp; <font color="blue">While sometimes verbose in its introduction and asides,</font> <i>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</i> is excellent when it settles down to its original intentions: &quot;to lend unprecedented clarity to the often elusive arts of the Indonesian archipelago, making them more accessible to the serious, self-defense driven student than ever before.&quot
