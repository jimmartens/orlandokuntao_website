                    Is it <i>kempo</i> or <i>kenpo</i>?  Even among its practitioners there is disagreement.
                    Some call their art kenpo (spelled with an "n"), while others say it is kempo (spelled with an
                    "m").  More than a few have come to recognize that, for the most part, the art referred to as
                    kempo (Chinese or otherwise), is the one that was transmitted to us from Okinawa or Japan.
                    The term kenpo, on the other hand, speaks of the art that comes to us via Hawaii.  Both share
                    common roots, for kenpo from Hawaii originally came from Okinawa and Japan.  Yet for all their
                    commonality, there remains that puzzling difference in spelling.  Why?

                  &nbsp;<a name="fn1_back"></a>
                  <br>Many explanations for the discrepancy have been suggested.  One author, for example, suggested
                    that kempo referred to the animal nature in man, and kenpo referred to that same kempo (animal) nature,
                    later disciplined and controlled.<small><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></small> That
                    explanation may or may not be valid, but the writer offers little evidence to substantiate it.
                    Unfortunately, this is often the case.
                  <p>Further, although many of the art's practitioners call it Chinese kenpo (or kempo), the word, as
                    pronounced, is not Chinese.  It is, to be precise, the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese word
                    <i>ch'uan&nbsp;fa</i>.  <i>Ch'uan&nbsp;fa</i> has been translated variously as "fist law,"
                    "fist way," "way of the fist," "boxing principles," or just plain "boxing."  These meanings
                    correspond to those Japanese-speaking authors offer for kempo.
                  <br>&nbsp;<a name="fn2_back"></a>
                  <br>In numerous publications, Japanese-speaking authors consistently Romanize the word as kempo (with an
                    <i>m</i>).  For example, in his book <i>This is Karate</i>, Mas Oyama refers to this art as
                    Chinese kempo and says it means '"fist fighting" or "boxing."<small><sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></small>
                    Another author, Okinawan Master Ryusho Sakagami, makes a similar reference to Chinese
                    kempo.<small><sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></small> These are just two examples of the many
                    Japanese-speaking authors and martial artists who use the same term for this art &mdash; and their
                    definitions provide the first key to determining the correct pronunciation of the word kempo.
                  <br>&nbsp;<a name="fn4_back"></a>
                  <br>The written language of the Japanese consists of Chinese characters (adopted
                    by the Japanese centuries ago), and several good linguistic sources are available for those interested
                    in its study.  James Curtis Hepburn's Japanese and English Dictionary, a long-standing authority
                    on the Japanese language, lists seven Romanized words pronounced <i>ken</i>.<small><sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></small>
                    (Remember, <i>ken</i> is the romanized pronunciation; not the actual spelling.)
                  <p>Multiple words having the same pronunciation but differing in both spelling and meaning are not at
                    all unusual.  They exist in all languages, and only the spelling or context indicates the intended
                    meaning.  In English, for example, the words <i>there</i>, <i>their</i>, and <i>they're</i> have
                    different spellings and meanings, but their pronunciation is the same.
                  <p>The seventh <i>ken</i> in Hepburn's dictionary is the <i>kanji</i> (character or pictogram) we seek
                    and its definition is, "a&nbsp;game played with the hands".  That having been located, the search shifts
                    to the second part of the word kenpo: <i>po</i>.  That one, however, proved a bit more difficult.
                    In Hepburn's dictionary, <i>po</i> is not listed at all.  It turns out that the <i>kanji</i> for
                    <i>po</i> is actually a simple word (that is, not part of another word, but one that can stand by
                    itself).  As a simple word it is correctly pronounced <i>ho</i>.  Hepburn lists six words
                    Romanized to <i>ho</i>.  The fourth one is our <i>kanji</i> character, and its meaning is "rule" or
                    "law."  The literal translation of these two simple words, then, is "a game played with the
                    hands," plus "rule" or "law."  Shifting gears from a literal (rearranged) translation of
                    "the rules of a game played with hands" to a sense-for-sense translation results in "boxing rules" or
                    "boxing principles" (also commonly known as "fist way," "way of the fist," etc.).  However,
                    it is not pronounced <i>kenho</i>; there are other linguistic rules that must still be applied.
                  <p>Remember, the <i>po</i> is pronounced <i>ho</i> when it stands alone (as a simple word).
                    However, making a compound word with <i>ho</i> as the second syllable changes the pronounciation:
                    <i>ho</i> becomes <i>po</i>.  If the search were to stop here, the result would be <i>kenpo</i>;
                    however, according to some sources yet another linguistic rule remains to be applied.  The other
                    rule that comes into play when making a compound word from these two simple words is as follows:
                    <a name="fn5_back"></a>
                    <blockquote>
                      final <i>n</i> (<img src="images/kanji_n.gif" alt="Kanji 'n'" width="20" height="14">), when at the end of
                      a word has always the sound of <i>ng</i>; as <i>mon&nbsp;==&nbsp;mong</i>, <i>san</i>&nbsp;==&nbsp;<i>sang</i>,
                      <i>shin</i>&nbsp;==&nbsp;<i>shing</i>; but in the body of a word, when followed by a syllable
                      beginning with <i>b</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>p</i>, it is pronounced like <i>m</i>.
                      ... Before the other consonants it has the sound of <i>n</i>.<small><sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></small>
                    </blockquote>
                  <p>A similar linguistic parallel is found in English.  The letter "p", for example, is always
                    pronounced as "p" (as in the words grape, grapple, etc.), except when it is followed by the letter
                    "h".  In the word graph, for example, the "p" is pronounced "f".  According to some, then,
                    correct Japanese grammar dictates, then, that the word is kempo (with an "<i>m</i>").
                  <p>Do these linguistic rules make kempo the right name and kenpo wrong?  No.
                    It may be, quite simply, an uncorrected mistake.  The name of our school, <i>Je&nbsp;du-too</i>
                    ( <sub><img src="images/ji_du_tu_horiz.gif" alt="'Je du-too' in Chinese" width="78" height="23" vspace="1"></sub> )
                    is such a Romanization mistake.  At&nbsp;the time when we chose that name  we simply did not know
                    how to Romanize the Chinese word we sought.  It, therefore, might also be that some consciously
                    decided to spell their art kenpo, feeling that it had sufficiently changed or evolved to the point
                    that it was no longer the kempo of old.  (Perhaps this is why kenpo from Hawaii is spelled with
                    an "n".)  Such an act is both honest and honorable.  Honest because it says that any
                    mistakes we may or may not make in our art are not to be laid at the feet of our teachers or
                    predecessors.  It is also honorable because it acknowledges the contributions of all who came
                    before us.<br>&nbsp;
