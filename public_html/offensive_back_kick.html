              One of the reasons we cannot spar or play in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is because we train using very dangerous,
              street-effective combative methods, techniques, and tactics.  One such method is our
              <b><i>Offensive&nbsp;Back&nbsp;Kick</i></b>.

              We use the <i>Offensive Back-Kick</i>&thinsp; to destroy our opponent's ability to fight &mdash; what we call, his&thinsp;
              "ability to wage war."  We direct the kick to our opponent's knees.  It bears repeating, this kick <i>IS</i>
              a <b>back-kick</b> and <b><i>not</i> a side kick</b>. For those who might not know, the difference
              between a back-kick and a "traditional" side-kick is largely the knee orientation of the kicker.  In the
              back-kick, the knee of the kicking leg is usually lower (or as low as) the kicker's kicking foot.  Beyond
              "knee orientation," the position of the kicker's buttocks is also different.  With the back-kick, the
              kicker's buttocks is directed more toward the opponent.  The buttocks' position is precisely why it is called
              a <i>back</i>-kick.  In this <b>Back-kick</b> figure, you can see that the kicker's knee, shin, and foot
              are all on the same level.  And, while the stick figure may not make it quite as clear, its buttocks are directed more
              toward the opponent.  Now for the "traditional" <i>side</i>-kick.
              <img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">

            <p>The traditional <b>Side-kick</b> is just the opposite, and it does not matter whether the kick is practiced in Kungfu,
              Karate, or Taekwondo, the basic form remains the same.  When chambered, the kicker's knee is higher than
              his foot, and unless the kick goes higher than the hip, the knee remains higher than the foot.  Add to that
              the fact that the side of the kicker's hip is directed toward the opponent and you can understand why it is called
              a <i>side</i>-kick.<small><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></small> (Because we practice our "Offensive
              Back-Kick" as a direct attack on our opponent's near knee, both of these figures are shown as if they were
              striking the same target.)

            <p>So, how does one train and practice such a dangerous self-defense fighting method?  Believe it or not,
              one can actually practice this with a partner, as well as with a heavy, floor-standing bag.  Let's look
              first at <b>Training Partner Practice</b>.

              <font face="Verdana"><big><b>Training Partner Practice</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
              <br>Training partner practice actively involves both players.  By that we mean both are practicing skills they can use
              &mdash; one works on his kick while the other works on his defense.  In figure&nbsp;1a, both players assume a
              <i>defensive</i> posture  having their hands open at chin-height, held between themselves in what we call our
              <b><i>Bladed Ready</i></b>, "<i>Hey pal. What'd I&nbsp;do?</i>" position.  In the street, such questions
              are smart for a couple of reasons: First, because they often cause individuals to pause as they consider your words.
              Second, witnesses actually hear a plea for peace, reconciliation or resolution.  That can always help the defender
              should such an incident go to court.<small><sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></small> That said, the defender remains
              well positioned, being ever-so-slightly on the ball of his rear foot with a slight lean forward (head, hip, and heel
              aligned at a five to ten degree angle toward his opponent) to immediately take his defense to his opponent should the
              situation demand it.
              <img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="35" border="0">

            <center><img src="images/offensive_back_kick_1.gif" alt="Offensive Back Kick Training with Partner" align="top" width="707" height="200" border="0"></center>
            <p>In practice with a partner, Player-A (on the left) fires a controlled back kick to Player-B's near
              right leg (figure&nbsp;1b).  In training, the target is his near right leg because we regularly train
              in our dominant, right lead, <a href="strong_side_forward.html">Strong-side Forward</a> position.
              Also, with both players in a right lead, back-n&thinsp;'&thinsp;forth training is more efficient because little time is spent
              switching leads.  In the street, the assailant's near leg will very likely be his left; regardless, left
              or right makes absolutely no difference in this defense.

            <p>The trick here is for Player-A to pick up his lead foot and fire it knowing full well that gravity will pull him down
              (read <i>forward</i>&thinsp;).  Believe me, because there is no chamber or shuffle to shift weight, no one ever sees
              that kick coming.  By the time anyone does, they have already felt
              it.&nbsp;<img src="images/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" align="bottom" width="15" height="15" border="0">

            <p>Simultaneous to Player-A's kick, Player-B, expecting the kick, retracts his near right leg (figure&nbsp;1b)
              in a manner that looks like he is attempting to kick his own butt with his right foot.  Obviously, Player-A
              must still control his kick to his partner's leg as best he can, but again, his partner must also be fully
              prepared to bend his knee.  With that preparation, even if Player-A hits his partner's knee a little too
              hard, it will only serve to thrust his partner into him even faster, which is actually, Player-B's defense
              (figure&nbsp;1c).  Both learn from this training method making it a very effective way to train.

            <!-- <p><img src="images/bag_training_method.gif" alt="Bag Training Method" width="228" height="31" border="0"> -->
            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Bag Training Method</b></big></font>

              Since <i>Training Partner Practice</i> is controlled, another method for training this kick is necessary &mdash;
              one that allows the student to practice the needed drive and impact potential of this kick.  To accomplish
              that, we fire it with total commitment to a standing heavy bag (figures 2a and 2b).  Performed correctly,
              and the student can actually hold his figure&nbsp;2b position, evaluating it with momentary stability, and
              realistic penetration.  All of this training brings us to the actual application of this technique.

            <!-- <p><img src="images/actual_application.gif" alt="Actual Application" width="206" height="31" border="0"> -->
            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Actual Application</b></big></font>

              In this scenario one faces a boxer, in his traditional left lead with his fists up and ready to fight
              (figure&nbsp;3a).  Assuming our "<i>Hey pal. What'd I&nbsp;do?"&nbsp;</i> plea did not work, figure&nbsp;3b
              shows the back kick being fired at the same near-leg target.  The only difference is that in the street,
              ninety-plus percent of those opponents who face you will be in a natural or "traditional" left lead.
              As we said before, opponent in left or right lead changes nothing in regard to the effectiveness of this
              technique.  The effect of such a blow to your opponent's lead leg is most likely to be one of the
              following:

            <!-- <p><img src="images/likely_reaction.gif" alt="Likely Reaction/Result" width="257" height="31" border="0"> -->
            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Likely Reaction/Result</b></big></font>
            <center><img src="images/offensive_back_kick_4.gif" alt="Offensive Back Kick Training with Standing Bag" align="top" width="428" height="200" border="0"><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="210" border="0"></center>
              If your opponent is really lucky, then the blow might simply cause his near leg to slip back somewhat.
              It should still be severely damaged, but not necessarily broken.  Regardless, such an action will still
              tip him forward (figure&nbsp;4a), very likely planting his face on the deck.  We'll accept that bow as
              we get the heck out of there.

            <p>If, on the other hand, you catch him at an instant where his lead foot is firmly planted on the deck,
              his lead leg will likely be broken.  He will still tip forward and definitely go down (figure&nbsp;4b),
              but the damage will be far, far, more severe.

              <br>We said at the beginning that we cannot spar or play in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) because we train using very dangerous,
              street-effective combative methods, techniques, and tactics.  This is just one of those techniques.  Please
              understand, we are not trying to portray ourselves as the baddest dudes, but the fact remains that all sparring uses
              rules coupled with controlled blows that are <b>intended to protect</b> your training partner from
              serious injury.  Whether traditional or sport-karate tournament, or MMA opponent &mdash; they must protect the
              participants (which is precisely why they have <a href="UFC_rules.html">rules</a>).  This
              <i>Offensive Back-Kick</i> is just one of the many things that necessarily rule out sparring for us.
              We train for self-defense; not sport.  Our emphasis, therefore, remains on the practical.

              <br>Repeatedly taught in our classes is the fact that the only difference between the striking position or
              posture used when practicing our crossover back-kick (striking upward on the hanging heavy bag) and the posture
              used when practicing the offensive back-kick (striking at knee height) is the elevation of the kicker's
              foot.  The basic form for both kicks, what one may call the body's position or posture, is really
              identical.

            <p><a name="fn3_back"></a>
              Such a principle has been taught in our school for some time, but only recently have we had the needed
              photographs to provide the required perspective for empirical comparison: One showing the crossover
              back-kick striking a hanging heavy bag,<small><sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></small> and another showing
              the offensive back-kick striking a heavy bag standing on the floor.  Using those photos, the following
              composition was made possible.

            <p>In the illustrations below, to provide the needed context, you will see images showing the actual kicks
              striking their bags in the smaller photos near the bottom.  Immediately above those
              <i>context</i> photos are the larger images of the kicker (taken directly from the original
              photographs).  The kicker images are aligned (the crossover back image being simply rotated to a
              comparable, horizontal position) and placed side-by-side allowing one to actually compare the positions
              and postures, recognizing their obvious symmetry.  Absolutely amazing.  (It is always good to
              <i>see</i> that concepts taught are, in fact, true and verifiable.)

                <a name="fn1"></a>More than a few have contended that despite the back-kick's power advantage they still
                prefer the side-kick over the back-kick because they feel the side-kick does not expose their backs to
                their opponents.  They are correct in that assessment.  That said, if the truth be known,
                great achievement always involves greater risk.  When it comes to a fight then, everyone must choose
                on which side of <i>that</i> line they will stand&nbsp;&mdash; or fall.

                definitely <i>not</i> intended to be so.  In his famous work, <i>The Art of War</i>, Sun Tzu
                says, "The greatest excellence is to defeat the enemy <i>without</i> ever having to fight him"
                [emphasis added].  So, any time I&nbsp;can avoid a fight, I&nbsp;am always much, much better off and
                much safer than I&nbsp;would be if I&nbsp;got into one.  Get into any fight and you can be injured,
                even if you win.  What if you are shot!  And, even if you win but receive a broken tooth, you did
                <i>not</i> really win &mdash; your dentist did.  Again, our line, "<i>Hey pal. What'd I&nbsp;do?</i>"
                is really <i>not</i> intended to deceive.  <b>Our training is <i>NOT</i> for fighting</b> &mdash;
                it is totally for self-protection.  If we have to fight, we will, but fighting is our LAST option.

                striking high on the bag, the target is not intended to be an opponent's head.  Such a kick may
                actually go for an assailant's groin.  With the back-kick's ability to easily strike legs, groin,
                abdomen, or even the chest, the kick simply continues to drive up as far as needed, effectively
                penetrating through the target.  Again, the height of the kicker's foot in no way represents
                a blow to an opponent's head (that would be like using a 155mm howitzer to shoot an individual) &mdash;
                rather, it indicates depth of penetration.
