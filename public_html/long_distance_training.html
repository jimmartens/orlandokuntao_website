            <br>We're often asked if we have instructors in this location or that.&nbsp; The short answer is "No."&nbsp;
              That said, there are individuals across the country who have, to varying degrees, trained with us.&nbsp;
              One excellent example is my dear friend, J.C.&nbsp;Murphy.&nbsp; "Murph" lives in North Carolina.&nbsp;
              He holds a black belt in jujitsu and a brown belt in Shotokan karate, and he trained with us regularly for
              more than six years.&nbsp; Murph is one of the best martial artists I&nbsp;am privileged to know.&nbsp;
              That said, Murph does not have his own school.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe any training he may continue to do,
              he does so either solo or with friends.&nbsp; If you ran across Murph, you'd do well to see if you could
              train with him.&nbsp; He's good &ndash; very good.

            <p>There are also friends like Brian&nbsp;VanCise of
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.instinctiveresponsetraining.com">Instinctive Response Training</a> in
              Las Vegas, Nevada.&nbsp; Brian is a great guy with a world of martial knowledge and skill who also has
              affiliate schools in Alma, Michigan and elsewhere.&nbsp; He trains with a great bunch of guys, and has
              invited me to teach there a couple of times.&nbsp; He seeks no rank or certification from me &ndash;
              rather, he seeks to learn as much as he can, from as many solid teachers as he can find.&nbsp; That is his
              approach to becoming the best possible martial artist he can be and, frankly, they don't get much better
              than that.

            <p>Another such friend is Brian Jacobs of
              <a target="_blank" href="http://combatserrada.com">Combat Serrada Escrima</a> in Boston.&nbsp; A more
              dedicated student of the arts you'd be hard pressed to find.&nbsp; And you can find still others we
              recommend on our <a href="links.html">Links</a> web page.&nbsp; None of them do exactly what we do,
              but everyone of them provides excellent instruction.&nbsp; If you are near any of them, we recommend
              training there.&nbsp;

            <p>If you are in Japan, contact my friend <a href="mailto:pascalmasse@hotmail.com">Pascal Masse</a>.&nbsp;
              He has trained with me and is a very smart student of the arts (holds black belt rank in Japanese arts).&nbsp;
              Working with him actually helped us finish our published <a href="books_and_videos.html#ffootw_jump">Workbook</a> to our
              <a href="books_and_videos.html#ff_jump">Fighting Footwork of Kuntao and Silat</a> DVD series.

              &nbsp;<br>
              If the individuals identified above, as well as those listed on our <a href="links.html">Links</a> web
              page&nbsp; are no where near you, but you still wish to study our art, then this is what we generally
              recommend: First, read our two books, <a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump">Martial Arts America</a>
              (a "why&nbsp;do" book written from my heart) and
              <a href="books_and_videos.html#iff_jump">Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</a> (a "how&nbsp;to" book
              written from my head).&nbsp; These will tell you a lot about us &ndash; what we teach,&nbsp; what we
              don't and why,&nbsp; and why we train the way we do.&nbsp; Also check out the numerous articles on our
              web <a href="sitemap.html">site map</a>,&nbsp; We try to provide many pages of other useful training
              insights and information there.

            <p>Reinforcing what is important here, when it comes to the recommended order of our training material, the
              books are very important.&nbsp; <a href="books_and_videos.html#iff_jump">Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</a>
              actually covers things in it&nbsp; that are not as deeply addressed in any of our the videos because frankly,
              it would be boring just watching someone talk in a video at the needed level of detail to adequately
              cover al the issues.&nbsp;

            <p>We recognize that book reading is something becoming increasingly less interesting for much of our
              new "texting" and "twittering" culture, but <i>after</i>&nbsp; reading those books, watch the videos
              in the order listed above.&nbsp; Watch them straight through, as an overview without focusing on any
              particular item.&nbsp; The idea is to first get a macro-view of what's presented in the videos.&nbsp;
              Again, in that initial viewing, do not get into any one thing or the other.&nbsp; Such a micro-view of
              anything presented during an <i>over</i>view will only be distracting.&nbsp; After viewing them all, you
              should have some idea as to what you may be ready to study in depth.&nbsp; If such is not the case,
              then simply follow the order listed.

            <p>As the video companion to our book,
              <a href="books_and_videos.html#iff_jump">Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</a>,&nbsp;
              <a href="books_and_videos.html#fai_jump">Fighting Arts of Indonesia</a>&nbsp; reinforces what was written and
              well-illustrated in the book by showing many of the drills and techniques at speed.&nbsp; That book and video
              share the combat principles of kuntao-silat such as adhesion,&nbsp; whiplash,&nbsp; gyroscopic rotation,&nbsp;
              shearing,&nbsp; and seating.&nbsp; Once you fully understand those "fundamentals," then check out our web page,
              <a href="http://www.orlandokuntao.com/capturing_the_limb.html">Capturing the Limb</a>.&nbsp; There you will read
              about one more &ndash; one we did not discover until later.

            <p>With the fundamentals and principles presented&nbsp; now firmly under your belt,&nbsp; the time would be right
              to move on to our <a href="http://www.orlandokuntao.com/books_and_videos.html#ra_jump">Reflex Action</a>
              video.&nbsp; Sharing training drills that have proven themselves over time, <i>Reflex Action</i>&nbsp; actually
              develops critical hand skills and reflexes.&nbsp; Be aware, with the exception of a couple of solo training
              drills shared near the end of the video, these drills are two-man training drills &ndash; in other words, you
              will need a training partner to fully practice them.

            <p>Recognizing that finding the right training partner is not always easy, may we suggest the following: take our
              video, <a href="http://www.orlandokuntao.com/books_and_videos.html#ffo_jump">Fighting Forms of kuntao-Silat</a>,
              and begin working on our form <i>Elbow Exercise</i> (that you can study solo).&nbsp; When you feel have it down
              sufficiently, go to a public park and practice it there.  (That video comes with a
              <a href="fforms_workbook.html">workbook</a>, so you will have notes available to you even in a park.)&nbsp;
              You may have to do that a few times, but who knows, while practicing in the park you might be observed by
              someone who is interested in what you do &ndash; someone who will actually come up and talk with you,
              eventually becoming a training partner.&nbsp; If they do, share with them that you are also <i>studying</i>
              two-man training drills that require a partner.&nbsp; Ask if they would like to see them and then study them
              as well.&nbsp; If you are so blest, you may find both a good training partner as well as a new good friend.

            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Slower&thinsp; Practice&thinsp; Actually&thinsp; Makes&thinsp; One&thinsp; Quicker</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>In the two-man training drills, one thing <b><i>not</i></b>&nbsp; to focus on is <i>speed</i>.&nbsp; In our
              training, only the initial parry (what we call counts 1 &amp; 2) is practiced at full speed.&nbsp; Following
              the initial parry (<i>block-left</i>&nbsp; or <i>block-right</i>), precision and accuracy become far more
              important than speed, so we practice the rest of the motions slowly (not taichi slow, but definitely not
              fast).&nbsp; That's because when the adrenaline hits you in a fight, you will have all the speed you
              need.&nbsp; Accuracy, on the other hand, tends to be lost under adrenaline, so practicing it slower in the
              drills becomes critical there.&nbsp; Do that, and you will not lose accuracy in a fight.&nbsp; This seems
              counter-intuitive, we know, but contrary to what many might think (or feel), experience has shown that drill
              training provides a greater return on your training investment when practiced slower rather than faster.&nbsp;
              Believe it or not, practicing slower actually makes you quicker.

            <p>Aside from the preceding suggestions, if you feel that a little change in how you actually move, say,
              your hand this way or that, blends in better with skills you already developed in other prior
              training, then by all means incorporate such a change.&nbsp; The goal here is really that you take the
              material presented in the videos and <i>make it fit YOU</i>. &nbsp; We firmly believe that the art must
              change to fit the individual &ndash; not the other way around.&nbsp; And while we're speaking of
              "<i>fit the individual</i>", if you do not already have one, start an exercise program that includes
              weight training and cardio.&nbsp; No martial art works as well without the practitioner remaining in
              the best shape he can.

            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Seek a Good School</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>Whether you find a good training partner or no, we always recommend finding a good school (Chinese kenpo,
              Jeet&nbsp;Kune&nbsp;Do, or Filipino martial arts) &ndash; a school where you can train regularly.&nbsp; While there,
              keep your mind open to the things taught there, but remain true to&nbsp; <i>your</i>&nbsp; training
              goals.&nbsp; Whether you agree with everything taught in the school, you still have both exercise and
              training partners.&nbsp; Apply what you find helpful in the videos, combine it with what you learn in your
              local school, and you will learn a lot.

            <p>Lastly, as you practice what is taught in our videos, feel free to
              <a href="mailto:bob@orlandokuntao.com" onMouseOver="window.status='E-Mail Bob Orlando';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;">e-mail</a>
              us with questions.&nbsp; Further, if you visit <a href="location.html">our area</a> on vacation or for any
              other reason, feel free to stop by and play with us &ndash; no charge for playing in our regularly scheduled
              <a href="classes.html">classes</a> (be aware, you will have to wear both
              <a href="required_equip.html#groin_protection">a cup</a> and a pair of good
              <a href="recommended_training_shoes.html">training shoes</a>).

            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Intergalactic Organization</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>Organizationally, we have no national, international, or intergalactic association.&nbsp; Large organizations
              invariably become political, and politics always gets in the way of training.&nbsp; Neither do we offer any
              kind of long-distance learning or instructor certification program.  We offer no such training because,
              frankly, the quickest anyone has learned our entire system and earned a black belt certificate from us has
              been 7 years &ndash; and that was with regular tri-weekly instruction.  It is, therefore, unreasonable
              for anyone training across the country or around the world to achieve the same rank in any <i>less</i>
              time.  Further, for us to even attempt such a program would only cheapen the ranks of those who have
              diligently trained with us &ndash; we cannot and will not do that.

            <p>In closing, here are three words that will serve you best in your training: <i>practice, practice, practice.</i>
              Whatever other advice you receive in regard to your training, none is as certain to provide success as the
              faithful application of those three words.
