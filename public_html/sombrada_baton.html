            <p><big><b>Note:</b></big> This drill is very basic and is only one of many such drills.  More importantly, it is only a drill.  Mastering it will go a long way toward improving your self-defense skills, but it <i>will not</i> (repeat, <i><b>will not</b></i>) make you an escrimador.
            <p>The basic drill consists of five couplets of two-movement actions: an initial defensive action followed by a counterattack.  Each couplet follows this pattern, and practiced correctly, enables both players receive equal training time.
            <p>

                  <br>The drill begins with player-B (on the right) advancing with his right foot and attacking with a high right-hand strike that descends vertically toward player-A's head or face (called a 12-line in most Filipino systems).  Using this as the starting point, the drill progresses through a series of five couplets or linked pairs.  Each couplet begins with an initial defensive action followed by a counterattack.
                  <p>As player-B advances and attacks with his descending right-hand strike, player-A defends by first stepping back with his right foot as his left hand intercepts B's right arm (close to B's hand).  Simultaneously, A's baton (in his right hand) smashes his attacker's right elbow (Photo&nbsp;1a).
                  <p>Player-A's baton strikes from left to right as his left hand simultaneously carries B's attacking right arm right to left, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the blow while, at the same time, directing the attacker's weapon away.  Player-A ends his defense here with his baton pointed toward his opponent, forward of his face and only a few six inches away from it (Photo&nbsp;1b).
                  <p>Player-A now begins his counterattack &mdash; a diagonally descending right-to-left strike to the left side of player-B's face (Photo&nbsp;1c).  (What is important here is the line of attack, not the target because the line is easily applied to a variety of targets.)  With this counterattack, the first couplet is complete and player-B now gets his turn at defense and counterattack.

                  <br>Using his baton, player-B's initial defense is not a block.  Instead, it is a downward smash to the inside of A's right hand or wrist (Photo&nbsp;2a).  This defense is a two-count movement: the strike is the first count, and B's open left hand striking A's weapon-wielding arm (Photo&nbsp;2b) is the second.
                  <p>The two-count movement is important here because even if the blow (the first action) is successful, the defender may still retain his baton (albeit with a substantially weakened grip).  In that case, a sharp follow-up blow to the injured arm has an excellent chance of dislodging the weapon.
                  <p>Completing the second couplet, player-B counterattacks with the butt of the weapon to player-A's midsection (Photo&nbsp;2c).  (This blow is often substituted with a horizontal, left-to-right strike to A's abdomen &mdash; called a 4-line in Filipino systems.)

                  <br>Player-A's defense against B's last counterattack is a simple one: He simply drops his left arm over his opponent's as he pulls his abdomen back out of harm's away.  Simultaneously, player-A smashes counterclockwise from 11 O'clock down to 6 O'clock in a move called an <i>abanico</i> (Photo&nbsp;3a) against the outside of B's right elbow, forearm, or wrist.
                  <p>Checking the attack with his left hand might seem a better move; however, such a check requires much greater precision than a fast-moving baton attack allows.  Simply extending the left arm over and dropping it onto the attacking arm effectively redirects the opponent's attack.  The assailant's weapon arm naturally follows the line of seemingly least resistance (to the defender's midsection); however, with a slight outward movement of his left arm, the defender easily redirects the attack, which is exactly what player-A does.
                  <p>As Player-A guides B's weapon hand to his left, he brings his baton quickly down against B's head, neck, or collarbone, then blends that line into a withdrawal of his baton (Photos&nbsp;3b and 3c).  Concluding the third couplet is A's counterattack: a thrust to B's torso, as in Photo&nbsp;3d (a 5-line in Filipino systems).

                  <br>Player-B's response to A's thrust is a left-to-right redirection of A's weapon hand, coupled with a simultaneous right-to-left smash of A's forearm and wrist (Photo&nbsp;4a).  This crossing shear-like action has incredible power potential.
                  <p>B's counterattack is a quick left-to-right downward diagonal (called a 2-line in Filipino systems) blow to the right side of A's face (Photo&nbsp;4b).  (As was the case in the forehand action shown in Photo&nbsp;1c, the most important principle here is the line of attack, not the target.  Again, because the line of attack is easily followed against a variety of targets.)

                  <br>The final couplet we also call "curls."  As player-B makes his downward diagonal strike to the right side of A's head, neck, or collarbone, player-A intercepts B's right arm at or just above B's right elbow and immediately strikes upward from beneath (in an action that looks much like a "curl" in weight-lifting) and against B's rapidly descending right arm (Photos&nbsp;5a and 5b).  (It is important that A's left hand remain forward of his right weapon hand in this maneuver.  If they are reversed, A's left hand is highly susceptible to being pinned beneath his right if his right arm is pressed.)
                  <p>Completing this couplet finishes the drill.  From here, player-A advances with his right foot and attacks with a descending right-hand strike to player-B's head, as in Photo&nbsp;5c.  (The same action that player-B first used to start the flow.)  As player-A counterattacks, player-B withdraws, stepping back with his right foot and thus beginning his portion of this cyclical drill.

                  <br>This drill does not address every possible attack, nor does it teach all possible counters.  Moreover, even cursory discussion of other critical elements like angling and footwork has been omitted.  It does, however, show you how a variety of effective tactics can be developed very quickly for use against a variety of stick attacks.  With just one basic pattern, the student learns defensive tactics against assaults coming at him from a half-dozen common lines of attack.  It just doesn't get any easier than that.
