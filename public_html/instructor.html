            <br>With nearly four decades of training in martial arts, Ron has focused on the practical application of the art for the
            majority of that time.  In 1976, Ron started taking <i>Okinawa-Te</i> at the Thornton Recreation Center.  Even though
            <i>Okinawa-Te</i> is a traditional Japanese art, the instructor was focused on the practical side of the art.  After six
            years of training, Ron received his black belt from Earl Alston and taught the children's program for a year before taking
            a break to finish high school and attend Front Range Community College in Westminster, Colorado for Electronics.

            <p>Some time after that, Ron resumed his training with Earl and continued training until Alston retired in 1990.
            Seeking a place to train, Ron started to study at a <i>Nisei Goju-Ryu Karate</i> school on East Colfax run by
            Clifton C.&nbsp;Diggs.  This was another Japanese art with very intense classes that involved enthusiastic sparring
            sessions and drills done with bare feet on the sidewalks of East Colfax in February.

            <p>After several injuries with two bad knees, Ron sought after a gentler form of martial arts and found an <i>Aikido</i>
            school in Denver.  Ron studied there for three and half years, then acquired the rank of second kyu under Stephen Varjan
            before herniating lumbar discs L4 and L5 in his back while lifting weights.  After four years of chiropractic treatments
            and deciding against having back surgery, Ron finally found his martial arts "home" in training with Bob Orlando in 1998.
            Twelve years and a 25-page Black Belt thesis later, Ron received his black belt.  Two years after that Ron earned a
            <font color="firebrick"><b><i>Guru &ndash; Full Teacher &amp Rank</i></b></font> certificate.  Ron understands VERY well
            and teaches superbly what we do in our school.&nbsp; You can reach him via his e-mail: <b>Ron@OrlandoKuntao.com</b>&thinsp;.

            <br>A Colorado resident and computer professional since 1965, Bob&nbsp;Orlando was introduced to the martial arts while on
            active duty in the U.S.&nbsp;Marines.  However, it was not until after he left the Corps that the flicker of interest that
            was kindled there became his consuming fire.

            <p>In 1968 Orlando began serious study in Chinese kenpo-karate<small><sup>&thinsp;<a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></small>.  Shortly
            thereafter he switched to kung fu, studying under <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dacascoswhkd.com">Al&nbsp;Dacascos</a>
            (then teaching in Denver, Colorado).  His training with Dacascos lasted nearly four years, until a back operation made it
            impossible to continue in Dacascos' high-kicking style of kung&nbsp;fu.

            <p>It was back to kenpo.  There Bob received his first-degree black belt from Dr.&nbsp;John&nbsp;P. Cochran.  Although Bob
            has subsequently earned additional rank in multiple arts, he prefers to say that he is a life-long student of the arts and
            leave it at that.  &quot;Rank,&quot; he says, &quot;is excess baggage.  It&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;hindrance to learning because
            everyone expects that you already know everything.&quot;

            <p>Ever a student of the arts, Bob's quest for knowledge has taken him into aikido, Small-Circle Jujitsu, grappling, iaido,
            and Filipino martial arts.  However, the  period in his training which he calls <i>catalytic</i> was the time spent studying
            Chinese kuntao and Dutch-Indonesian pukulan pentjak silat under master <a href="willem_de_thouars.html">Willem de&nbsp;Thouars</a>.
            After a decade of training with de&nbsp;Thouars, Bob received his teaching certificate from him in 1994.

            <p>A graduate of a Jesuit university, Bob is the author of <i><a href="books_and_videos.html#iff_jump">Indonesian Fighting
            Fundamentals</a>: The Brutal Arts of the Archipelago</i>, <i><a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump">Martial Arts America</a>:
            A Western Approach to Eastern Arts</i>, and four highly recommended martial art <a href="books_and_videos.html">videos</a>.
            While owner and operator of his own school, Bob still considers himself a &quot;full-time&quot; student of the arts.  His
            school is a small one, and that's just the way he likes it.  &quot;Our school is our laboratory.  There, we test everything
            from the practicality of forms training and techniques, to the latest craze (or <i>crazies</i>) in self-defense.  We have a
            formal curriculum &mdash; from white to black belt &mdash; although it is not cut in stone.  I&nbsp;guess that for us, the
            concrete is never quite dry, for we (including myself) are constantly learning.&quot;

            <p>Of his own abilities, he says,
            <blockquote>
              I&nbsp;have skills.  After almost 50 years in the arts &mdash; I&nbsp;should.  My skills, however, came not because of any
              natural physical ability, but because I&nbsp;worked very hard with the God-given talent with which I was blest to get
              to where I&nbsp;am today.  My strengths are my singleness of purpose, my unwavering dedication to personal excellence
              in self-defense, and my analytical mind.  My contribution to the art comes not from what I&nbsp;can do physically.
              Rather, it comes from my ability to effectively share what I&nbsp;know with others.  I&nbsp;take the complicated and
              make it simple.&nbsp; <i>I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="teacher.html" target="main_display_area">teacher</a></i>.
            </blockquote>
