                  &nbsp;<br>
                  Equality in martial art training begins with acceptance of this fact: <i>physically, all are not created
                  equal</i>.&nbsp; If everyone was the same size and build, and came with the same physical attributes,
                  teaching martial arts would be a lot easier.&nbsp; This is not, however, the case.&nbsp; Still, all students
                  deserve the opportunity to train and study in an environment free of sexual advances, condescending attitudes,
                  and macho behavior.&nbsp; A good teacher (and most teachers are male) can do much to encourage positive
                  participation and discourage negative conduct on the part of his male students.&nbsp; But the responsibility
                  for equality in training rests on more than just masculine shoulders.&nbsp; Female students have an equal
                  responsibility.&nbsp; If female martial artists expect awareness and consideration of their feelings and
                  their training needs from male instructors and training partners &ndash; something they have every right to
                  expect &ndash; then they, in turn, have a responsibility to acknowledge and consider masculine needs as well.
                <p>Acknowledging, accepting, and then training within the constraints of our differences is the only way
                  that real inequality in training will ever disappear.&nbsp; Practical suggestions [like wearing
                  <a href="required_equip.html#breast_protection">breast</a> and even
                  <a href="required_equip.html#female">groin&nbsp;protection</a> so the female student can stand in as a
                  substitute male opponent suitable for her male training partner] are just a start, but they are far more
                  realistic than the rhetoric that routinely overshadows this issue.&nbsp; By beginning here, the male and
                  female student alike can train equally, grow, and become the martial artist each is capable of becoming.

              Iowa wrestling standout refuses to face girl

                          By Luke Meredith, AP

[Photo:woman_wrestler_wins.tif] Cedar Falls' Cassy Herkelman gets her
arm raised after winning by default in...

DES MOINES, Iowa - A standout Iowa high school wrestler refused to
compete against a girl at the state tournament on Thursday,
relinquishing any chance of becoming a champion because he says
wrestling a girl would conflict with his religious beliefs.

Joel Northrup, a home-schooled sophomore who was 35-4 wrestling for
Linn-Mar High School this season, praised his first-round opponent,
Cedar Falls freshman Cassy Herkelman, and Ottumwa sophomore Megan Black,
who became the first two girls to make the state wrestling tournament in
its 85-year history.

But in a brief statement issued through his school, Northrup said he
defaulted on his match with Herkelman because he doesn't think boys and
girls should compete in the sport.

"I have a tremendous amount of respect for Cassy and Megan and their
accomplishments.  However, wrestling is a combat sport and it can get
violent at times," said Northrup.  "As a matter of conscience and my
faith I do not believe that it is appropriate for a boy to engage a girl
in this manner.  It is unfortunate that I have been placed in a
situation not seen in most other high school sports in Iowa."

There were several thousand fans at Wells Fargo Arena on Thursday, but
many were watching other matches when the referee raised Herkelman's
hand to signal her win.  There was a smattering of cheers and boos from
the crowd before Herkelman was whisked into the bowels of the arena.

Tournament organizers declined to make Herkelman available for
questions.  She entered the tournament with a 20-13 record and will
wrestle Friday in the quarterfinals of the 112-pound weight class.

Her father, Bill Herkelman, told The Associated Press via text message
that he understands and respects Northrup's decision.

"It's nice to get the first win and have her be on the way to the medal
round," Bill Herkelman wrote.  "I sincerely respect the decision of the
Northrup family especially since it was made on the biggest stage in
wrestling.  I have heard nothing but good things about the Northrup
family and hope Joel does very well the remainder of the tourney."

Because he defaulted and didn't forfeit, Northrup was allowed to compete
in the consolation rounds, and he won his first match later Thursday by
major decision.

He was spared any chance of meeting up with Black, who also wrestles at
112 pounds and was 25-13 entering the tournament, when she was
eliminated after being pinned in both of her matches.  But it's possible
Northrup and Herkelman could be matched again if both make the finals of
the consolation bracket.

Northrup's father, Jamie Northrup, is a minister in the Believers in
Grace Fellowship, an independent Pentecostal church in Marion that
believes young men and women shouldn't touch in a "familiar way," said
Bill Randles, the church's pastor. [http://www.believersingrace.com/page/page/5840982.htm].]

"We believe in the elevation and respect of woman and we don't think
that wrestling a woman is the right thing to do.  Body slamming and
takedowns, that full contact sport is not how to do that."

Randles said Joel has been involved in wrestling for many years, and he
and his family have discussed before the possibility of girls getting
involved in the sport.

"It's totally his choice.  He's a young man now and he's worked hard to
get where he's gotten.  It's up to him, and it was his conviction" not
to wrestle Herkelman.

Black said Northrup refused to wrestle her three years ago, and that she
respects him for adhering to his beliefs.

"If it's his religion and he's strong in his religion, then I just
respect that," Black said.  "Obviously, everyone can be pointing fingers
at him.  He, at least, is true to his beliefs and you have to respect
that.  It takes a lot for a 15- or 16-year-old boy to do."

Marth Stetzel, a Perry mother whose two sons were taking part in the
tournament, said she also didn't have a problem with Northrup's
decision.

"We're really raising kids that are going to be bigger than wrestling,
and if it's something that he believes strongly in - which is not
necessarily what I would do - you've got to respect a kid like that,"
Stetzel said.

Wrestling is extremely popular in Iowa, and Black and Herkelman are the
first girls to qualify for the state tournament since it was first
sanctioned by the Iowa High School Athletic Association in 1926.

According to the National Federation of State High School Associations,
more than 6,000 girls competed in wrestling in 2009-10 - compared with
nearly 275,000 boys.  Though most states require girls to wrestle boys,
California, Hawaii, Texas, Washington and Tennessee sponsor girls-only
high school wrestling tournaments.
