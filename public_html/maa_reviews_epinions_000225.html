            <p><b>Martial Arts Modernized</b>
            <p><b>Pros:</b> Sensible look at martial arts and where they can/should be going.
            <p><b>Cons:</b> More people haven't read it!
            <p><font color="blue">What first caught my attention about Bob Orlando's <i>Martial Arts America</i> was the fact that the book was dedicated to Ed Parker, the founder of American Kenpo Karate--a martial arts system I've been studying for several years.&nbsp; American Kenpo is all about examining the martial arts and identifying the parts that make sense in today's environment.&nbsp; I'm a big fan of Ed Parker's system and his philosophy about the martial arts, so I figured any book dedicated to him couldn't be half bad.</font>
            <p>Martial Arts America is not an instructional book--you won't find page after page of guys in long belts posing as if they're attacking each other.&nbsp; Rather, it's a discussion of the shortcomings of many Eastern martial arts as they relate to our Western culture, and how to address these disparities.
            <p>The book is centered on what Orlando calls his "Central Truth": <i>Philosophies and methods of instruction must match the culture of those being instructed</i>.&nbsp; This isn't intended as any kind of racist or ethnocentric theme; it's simply his philosophy for maximizing the effectiveness of martial arts training.
            <p>Orlando begins with "Why study martial arts?" and defines aspects of the practice such as sport, self-defense, art, and combat.&nbsp; He then goes on to the heart of the book, namely the evolution and adaptation of the martial arts.&nbsp; Why is it necessary, what obstacles does it face, and how do we go about deciding <b>how</b> it is to evolve?&nbsp; Where should tradition be preserved and where should it be set aside in favor of something with more relevance to modern circumstances?
            <p>There is some discussion of practical matters such as whether forms (Kata) training is worthwhile, whether to train in shoes or barefoot, and examples of traditional techniques that might not be as useful as we hope (citing the ineffectiveness of traditional blocks against, for instance, someone trained in modern boxing).
            <p>There are several very interesting chapters about reconciling the spiritual and metaphysical aspects of eastern arts with the more scientifically oriented philosophies of the west.&nbsp; There's even a chapter about women in the martial arts.
            <p>The final chapters are excellent for beginning martial arts students, or for those planning to enroll in classes.&nbsp; They're lessons in how to find a good school/teacher: what are the signs of a good school, and what clues should tell you to run, don't walk, to the nearest exit?
            <p>Martial Arts America is filled throughout with examples, illustrations, and some great cartoons that light-heartedly point out some of the flaws in martial arts philosophy and practice.
            <p>Overall <font color="blue">a very good book for anyone with interest in the martial arts, from beginner on up to the highest ranks!</font>
