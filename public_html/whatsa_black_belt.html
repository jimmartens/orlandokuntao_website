              which the West can thank China are paper money and martial arts.  These are not entirely dissimilar because there
              exists, even today, a remarkable parallel between these two human inventions.
            <p>In 1260 A.D., the Yuan government made paper money the only legal tender throughout the Chinese empire.  No longer
              would a nation's wealth and prestige be seen by enormous stacks of gold and silver, but by the faces and images on its paper
              currency.
            <p>Paper money offers numerous benefits over minted coinage (it's lighter to carry around for one thing), and as long as an
              economy remains productive paper currency works very well &mdash; so well, in fact, that today it is used around the
              world.  No rational nation on the earth would ever consider going back to a gold standard.  However, for all
              of its benefits, paper money has two major weaknesses:  It is highly susceptible to forgery and inflation.
              So it is with the martial arts.
            <p>Although all Asian martial arts did not originate in China, it is still fair to say that the all Asian martial arts have,
              to varying degrees, been influenced by China's martial traditions.  Like China's paper money, Asian martial arts have
              spread throughout the world.  However, just as currency evolved from gold and silver to paper representations of the
              same, so too have the martial arts.  No longer are the martial arts represented by the skill and power of its
              practitioners, but by the faces, images, and signatures displayed on "black belt" certificates.  Moreover, with all
              of its popularity, martial arts, like paper currency, have proven highly susceptible to, you guessed it, forgery and
              inflation.  This is most obvious when we consider the denomination of choice, the black belt.

            <br>The question sounds simple enough, yet despite the plethora of martial art publications today, there are surprisingly
              few books or articles that attempt to define or even describe exactly what a black belt is.  In fact, my own search
              of more than a dozen martial art texts and numerous periodicals turned up not a single definition of the highly "coveted"
              rank.  To find one I&nbsp;had to turn to stable references such as encyclopedias and dictionaries.<p>The 1998 edition
              of <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> refers to a black belt in the context of judo.  "White belts are worn by novices
              and black by masters, with intermediate grades denoted by other colors."  (So, masters wear black belts.  Hmmm.)
              According to <i>Webster's New World Dictionary</i> (1984) a black belt is "awarded to an <b><i>expert of the highest
              skill</i></b> in judo or karate" [emphasis added].
            <p>If these definitions are indicative of the uninitiated public's perception of a black belt, then a black belt in their
              eyes is at least "an expert of the highest skill" (except, of course, to those who have successfully beaten up
              one or more claimants).  Some may disagree that this is the public's perception, but how many times have martial
              artists &mdash; black belts &mdash; heard comments like, "I'll be sure not to mess with you" or "We're all safe with you
              around," after being introduced and identified as a black belt?  Arguments to the contrary aside, the general
              association of the term "black belt" with attainment of the highest level of expertise in the martial arts is a common
              one.<br>&nbsp;
            <!-- <p><img src="images/defacto_std.gif" alt="Defacto Standard" width="197" height="23" border="0"> -->
            <p><font face="Verdana"><big><b>Defacto Standard</b></big></font><img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0">
            <br>Those connected with &mdash; though not necessarily knowledgeable about &mdash; the martial arts may ask: "Why all the
              fuss?  Everyone knows what a black belt is."  Is that so?  We know what those outside the martial arts think
              they know what a black belt represents, but does their definition match what we, those intimately familiar with the arts,
              believe?  Hardly.  Even within the martial arts community itself, where no accepted objective standard for the
              rank exists, the answer is still a resounding "no."
            <p>Ask a dozen instructors, "What is a black belt?" and you will receive a 12 very different answers.  Granted, most of
              the differences can be attributed to stylistic issues (e.g. Chinese practitioners say there is so much more to learn in their
              arts that it simply takes longer to earn a black belt in their schools than it does in those that teach other Asian arts),
              but other differences are essentially market-driven.  For instance, one school owner confided, "My students' parents
              expect their child will be a second-degree black belt by age 12.  If not, they will take him elsewhere."
            <p>Ironically, the general public has a fairly uniform understanding what is a black belt &mdash; an expert of the highest
              skill &mdash; yet many parents expect their children will attain that level before they reach puberty.
              Inflated parental estimations and expectations aside, does anyone really believe that the local Mini Hanshi Karate-Mart
              can produce genuine "experts of the highest skill" before the candidates reach puberty, much less maturity?  It is just
              such situations that make the question, "What is a black belt?" highly relevant because we (martial art practitioners and
              instructors) are evaluated and compared based on the public's perceptions and expectations &mdash; as whimsical and
              unrealistic as they may be.

                  <br>We cannot fault non-martial artists for holding such an idealistic, albeit erroneous, perception of a what a
                    black belt is.  We, as martial artists, are partly to blame for their misunderstanding because we ourselves
                    do not hold a uniform, singular or consistent view of the rank.  A part of me (the idealistic side) wishes we
                    had an accepted and objective standard for the coveted belt.  But logically, I&nbsp;know full well that any
                    definition would be so broad and watered down that the only way the term "black belt" would mean anything would be
                    to tack on numerous degrees.
                  <br>&nbsp;<a name="fn1_back"></a>
                  <br>Sadly, this has already happened. &nbsp; In the second edition of <i>Who's Who in American Martial Arts</i>,
                    published in 1985, the late kenpo master William K.S.&nbsp;Chow is listed as a 15th degree black
                    belt<small>&thinsp;</small>!<small><sup>&thinsp;<a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></small> If anyone in the last
                    100 years deserved recognition for his dedication to and skill in the martial arts, Chow certainly did, but his
                    claim to 15th degree came about precisely because black belts had become so cheap that even this master's
                    credentials had to be pumped up to be recognized for their true value.

            <p>Given the great disparity between public perception and reality, martial artists to whom the belt is still "coveted" are
              increasingly pressured to lower their standards.  Those who refuse face extinction.  Refusing to compromise
              their standards, many, even now, teach only in small I-wish-it-could-be-for-profit schools, holding day jobs to make
              their living.

              <br>Despite the uninitiated public's fairly uniform expectation of what is a black belt and what it represents, the
              reality is that the coveted rank is not so easily defined.  Like paper currency, black belt rank is subject to
              the risks of inflation, but with an important difference &mdash; the worth of paper money is objectively established by
              comparing it with other stable currencies.  Such comparisons are all but impossible in the martial arts because
              requirements for black belt vary widely between arts, between schools, and between teachers.  However, there is
              a parallel from outside the martial arts that may help.
            <br>&nbsp;<a name="fn2_back"></a>
            <br>Looking at higher education we can compare the time requirements for receiving a black belt with the time required to
              earn a bachelor's degree in, say, physical education or kinesiology?  Excluding the 12 years of education that must
              precede college, four years of <i>concentrated</i> instruction are required to earn a bachelor's degree.  The typical
              "Black Belt" program only involves a couple of hours a night, a few days a week.  But let's take it a step further.
              Does that bachelor's degree qualify the recipient as an <i>expert</i> in his or her field?  Hardly.  Such a
              degree really only prepares one to seriously learn.  Moreover, it takes many more years of "concentrated" study and
              experience to earn "expert" status in that or any other field.<small><sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></small>
              All three disciplines &mdash; physical education, kinesiology, and martial arts &mdash; focus on primarily physical training,
              so the basis for this comparison is actually quite reasonable.  Looked at that way and you can draw your own
              conclusions regarding the relative value of a black belt from this school or that.
            <p>The real problem remains &mdash; and this is the core issue &mdash; that the black belt represents an ideal, not some
              tangible product; and just as paper currency is only as strong as the government that stands behind it, a black belt
              certificate is only as good as the training that went into it, the standards that were met to earn it, and the instructor
              who awarded it.  Black belt, then, means, simultaneously, everything and nothing.  Everything for the life-long
              practitioner.  Everything for the individual whose life depends on "expert" skill.  <i>Nothing</i> to those who
              routinely turn out inflated paper certificates.
