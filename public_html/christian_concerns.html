                &nbsp; The following is an expanded version of a letter originally submitted to <i>Martial Arts Professional</i>
                magazine in response to the publisher's sincere question, "How do you deal with the dichotomous nature of
                Eastern and Western philosophy?" (MAPro, January 2001)
              </small>
            </blockquote>
            <hr size="-1" noshade>
            <p>As a Christian and a martialist, I&nbsp;am intimately familiar with the tension that exists between
              Eastern martial arts study and Western religion.  For example, I&nbsp;know Christians who struggle
              with their perceived conflict between Christ's edict to "turn the other cheek" and studying martial arts
              for self-defense.  By the same token, I&nbsp;know non-Christian martial artists who believe the
              cheek-turners get what they deserve if they refuse to defend themselves in the face of a physical attack.
              I&nbsp;also know devout Christians who feel that just bowing in a martial arts school has religious overtones
              and are, therefore, uncomfortable with the practice.  In each of these cases, the issue in question is
              whether there is a conflict between belief in Western religion and the practice of Eastern martial arts.
              At the root of this controversy are a serious communication breakdown on the one hand and a fundamental
              misunderstanding of Scripture on the other.
            <br>&nbsp;<a name="fn1_back"></a>
            <br>
              What makes the issue of Eastern martial arts versus Western religious beliefs so difficult is the failure
              of those on both sides of the issue to speak to the heart of the other's reality in presenting their respective
              points of view.  For example, those holding deep religious convictions need to recognize that biblical
              arguments and references do nothing to convince those who do not accept their scriptural
              authority.<small><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></small> Likewise, nonbelievers must
              recognize that all the logic in the world will not sway the individual who truly believes in a higher
              spiritual authority.  Thus, as a Christian and a teacher of martial arts, I&nbsp;have found that the
              best way to discuss this contentious (and often deeply personal) topic is to do so from two distinct
              perspectives:  a secular one for my nonbelieving friends and acquaintances, and a scriptural one for my
              Christian brothers and sisters.  Martial arts instructors who believe, as I&nbsp;do, that no conflict
              exists can make their case most effectively by taking one or the other approach, depending on where they
              stand in the religious spectrum.

              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <!-- Table 1a -->
                <tr>
                  <td align="justify">
                    I&nbsp;address the subject from a secular perspective in detail in my book
                    <i><a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump">Martial Arts America</a>: A&nbsp;Western Approach to Eastern
                    Arts.</i> There, I&nbsp;point out that martial arts instructors need to face one indisputable
                    fact: Asian martial arts philosophy <i>is</i> deeply entrenched in Eastern mysticism and
                    religion.  As such, some martial art practices are simply incompatible with a number of
                    Judeo-Christian religious beliefs.  However, this does not mean that we cannot teach Asian martial
                    arts to devout Western students.  <i>(Click

                  </td>
                  <td valign="top" align="left">
                    <a href="books_and_videos.html#maa_jump">

                  </td>
                </tr>
              </table> <!-- E.O. Table 1a -->

            <br>
              The philosophical and religious aspects of the Eastern martial arts are not so tightly entwined with the
              physical principles that the two cannot be separated.  In fact, the former are not at all necessary
              for developing the physical skills that the overwhelming majority of our students seek.  Since they
              are, in fact, unnecessary, and since some (potential customers) are sensitive to the issue of Eastern
              religious influences, then the wise teacher either learns which aspects are offensive and why and avoids
              them, or he thoroughly and frequently explains the functional purpose behind any practice that may be
              perceived as part and parcel of Eastern religion.

            <p>
              Unlike the secular approach, the scriptural perspective must appeal to both logic <i>and</i> the authority
              of Scripture, with Biblical references and citations to support all arguments.  For example, when addressing
              the issue of "turning the other cheek," I&nbsp;usually begin by citing passages wherein the apostles (and even
              Jesus himself) did not simply yield to physical assault.  When tackling the question of religious influences
              in Eastern martial arts, I&nbsp;discuss both meditation and bowing.  Every step of the way, I&nbsp;appeal to
              reason <i>and</i> draw from Scripture to support my belief that these two practices need not necessarily be
              in conflict with Judeo-Christian religious beliefs.

                specifically addressing Christian participation in Asian martial arts.)
              </i>
            <p>For those determined to incorporate their personal religious beliefs and convictions into their martial art
              instruction, allow me to add this final point as food for thought:
