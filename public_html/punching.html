            <p>It is an indisputable fact of life that the things we learn early on in any discipline, impact us the most
              in subsequent practice or application of that discipline.  What we learn, for example, in elementary
              school, and especially in those early years, carries over well into high school and college.  Our values,
              study habits, presuppositions and much, much more, are established largely during the first grades.
              This is because the lessons learned and habits acquired in those first years of study in any new subject
              somehow imprint on the individual's mind.  The impressions made on that "clean blank
              slate"<small><sup><a href="#fn_1">1</a></sup></small> are pretty much permanent,
              and the things first written there, regardless of how often the slate is erased and written over, those things
              stay with us (sometimes haunting us) for years.

            <br><a name="fn_2_back"></a><a name="fn_3_back"></a>
            <br>Moreover, that "clean blank slate" principle is independent of physical age and is repeatedly demonstrated
              throughout life when, for example, individuals join the
              military<small>&thinsp;<sup><a href="#fn_2">2</a></sup></small>, enter the work force for the
              first time, and, as applicable to our discussion, when they begin martial arts training.
              Regardless of one's age, when we begin anything new, our minds in that discipline or area of knowledge
              are in reality, clean blank slates, and the task is to fill it with training that will serve us well over
              the years, rather than struggling to undo bad habits acquired early &mdash; habits that will remain
              stubbornly persistent.  All of this brings us to one of the first things taught in modern martial arts:
              <b><i><big>Punching</big></i></b>.<small><sup><a href="#fn_3">3</a></sup></small>

            <p>Elbows are more powerful, heel-palms are as effective as the best punches (<i>and</i> much safer for your
              hands), kicking extends one's striking range (and it's a lot flashier to boot
              <img src="images/smiley_12_x_12_white.gif" alt="Smiley Face" width="16" height="16" border="0"> ),
              but punching remains a fundamental skill and a basis for most techniques.  Still, as simple as punching may seem
              &mdash; everyone knows how, right? &mdash; teaching it involves three distinct and critical components:

                <td valign="top" align="justify">
                  The first two components are practiced largely solo, that is, without a training partner; the third component
                  is the place where a training partner becomes actively involved.  In this article, we examine all three,
                  but we will discuss each in the order of their complexity and criticality.  Let's start with the simplest:
                  <i>Punching Practice</i>.

                  <br>Punching practice is little more than punching with and without contact on a target &mdash; be it a
                  <i>makiwara</i> (padded striking post used as a training tool in various styles of traditional karate),
                  a boxing-type hanging heavy bag or a double-end bag, a wing chun-type training dummy, the modern "Bob
                  Punching Dummy," or a live training partner (hopefully not a dummy).
                  <p>Little more needs to be said about this kind of punching practice, but much more needs to be addressed about
                  <i>Forming the fist,</i> and &nbsp;<i>Punch Presentation</i>.  Let us begin with the forming of the fist &mdash;
                  for either striking or punching (two different things).

            <br>In its most natural formation, a fist is made simply by curling or rolling your fingers in, closing your hand, and
            allowing your thumb to fold over your index finger thereby locking the whole package together.  Such a fist is
            suitable for striking (making contact with the meat at the bottom of the fist &mdash; primarily the
            <i>Abductor Digiti Quinti</i> muscle), for we've all seen even little children<small>&thinsp;<sup><a href="#fn_4">4</a></sup></small>
            striking others with such fists.  However, such a fist may not be the best for <i>punching</i>
            (making contact with the boney metacarpophalangeal joints).

            <center><img src="images/clenched_fist.gif" alt="The Natural Fist" width="525" height="267"></center>

            <br>Doubtless, the natural clenched fist is suitable for striking as it works very well as a
            traditional <i>hammerfist</i>.  However, it must be pointed out that the hammerfist
            does not strike with the knuckles.  Striking with the knuckles requires changes in the
            fist's basic shape as well as in its alignment with regard to the intended target.

            <p>Since fangs and claws were entrusted only to those creatures that could responsibly handle them, and with the
            exception of the human brain (which far too many do not exercise sufficiently to avoid fights), what other natural,
            purely <i>physical</i> tools have humans for personal protection?  The reality is that all we have
            physically are feeble, blunt-ended limbs suitable only for striking other humans.

            <p>Before smashing immediately into that, we really need to understand something about what usually precedes punching:
            Namely, grabbing.  This is important because in a fight, grabbing inevitably leads to striking.  Let's take
            a quick look at how grabbing and punching can be very smartly connected and combined, and just how that impacts forming
            the fist.

              Mention <i>grabbing</i> and most immediately think of our assailants grabbing us.  However, in
              this discussion we need to consider how <i>we</i> should grab our assailants or anything
              else for that matter.

            <br><a name="fn_5_back"></a>&nbsp;
            <br>If you train for punching (ergo, striking with the knuckles), then the first thing that needs to be considered
              in grabbing is doing so <i>without</i> your thumb!  This is necessary because in a fight,
              the thumb very naturally <i>resists</i> any quick release of the grasp &mdash; you will see how
              important that is shortly.  Grasping without your thumb, allows you to quickly release your grip and move
              immediately to a blow (often the thing grasped is jerked out of our grips anyway).  The fact is, using the
              thumb when grabbing actually makes us more inclined to hang on (a good thing if your opponent has a knife).
              Instead, in a self-defense situation, most of the time we do better if, when we meet resistance, we simply release
              our grasp, strike a good target, and return to a grasp as need and opportunity presents
              it.<small><sup><a href="#fn_5">5</a></sup></small>

            <br><a name="fn_6_back"></a>&nbsp;
            <br>Instinctively, we tend to stick with our thumb-based grip because it is one of two reflexes with which we are born
              that remain with us our entire lives.  What do I mean by "reflexes with which we are born?"  Well, put a
              finger in a new-born's hand and what does the infant do?  The child reflexively grasps it.  The picture below
              is of Samuel Armus &mdash; a 21 weeks-old (inside the womb) child who was undergoing fetal surgery to correct
              <i>spina bifida.</i> At some point during the procedure, little Samuel's hand poked through the incision
              in his mother's womb and when Dr.&nbsp;Bruner offered his finger, the baby grasped it and held
              on.<small><sup><a href="#fn_6">6</a></sup></small>

            <center>
              <font size="-1">

            <p>That same natural reflex (even in an unborn child) is reinforced throughout our lives from finger grasping, to bottle
              holding, to eating, and even to holding your daily newspaper.  Want proof?  Ask yourself, what will you most
              likely do if someone pulls on the newspaper you are holding?  Answer: Like most of us, you will try to hang on
              to it!

            <br>With the obvious exceptions of hanging on to your daily newspaper and those grappling arts where thumb placement
              is critical to various hand and wrist locks, in our training we should practice in a way that tricks our natural
              grasp reflex so that we don't instinctively grab and reflexively hang on.  We can do this by grasping
              <i>without the thumb</i>.  "<b>Grasping Without The Thumb</b>" does not have the same mental imprint in the brain,
              therefore it does not trigger our natural, "hang on" reflex.  This means you won't reflexively fight as hard
              to retain what you're holding.

            <br>Recognizing full well that no grip is unbreakable, one can quickly release any thumbless, resisted or failed grasp,
              and roll right into a strike.  You continue striking until another grasp opportunity presents itself and then,
              if you wish to, you grab again.  Until then, you continue striking, which, by the way, "may" include
              punching.<small><sup><a href="#fn_7">7</a></sup></small>

            <p>Although many practice punching by working a traditional heavy bag, double-end balls, and speed bags regularly,
              experience shows that there are much better weapons for empty-hand striking than the fists.  For example,
              slapping can be surprisingly effective, and elbow strikes are, well, not so surprisingly, extremely effective.
              We will leave discussion of those weapons for another day, but for now, just recognize that "punching" is not the
              only striking method available to you.  That said, a smartly delivered punch from a well-formed fist can be a
              very effective blow for an otherwise unarmed human.   Since delivery, hand position, fist shape, and striking
              point all need to be understood when punching, let's look briefly at each.

            <br><a name="fn_8_back"></a>&nbsp;
            <br><font face="Verdana" size="+1"><b>Delivery</b></font>
            <img src="images/b.gif" alt="" align="top" width="0" height="30" border="0"> <!-- for desired space after the header -->
            <br>A truly powerful punch <i>MUST</i> be fast.  That fact comes from basic physics.
              The energy of a blow (its impact), depends on how fast the punch is thrown and how much weight is behind it.
              But between the two &mdash; velocity and mass &mdash; velocity is <i>most</i>
              important.<small><sup><a href="#fn_8">8</a></sup></small>

            <p>So what is the key to velocity?  First, never pull back or chamber your fist before striking.  This should
              be obvious, but the "chambering" practice still plagues most Asian martial arts practitioners, running counter to the
              ancient Chinese monk and martial arts master who said, "If you want to get from point A to point B really fast,
              <b>don't start by backing up!</b>"
              <img src="images/smiley_12_x_12_white.gif" alt="Smiley Face" width="16" height="16" border="0">

            <p>Chambering likely does not change the impact of the blow (i.e. the terminal velocity is equivalent).  However,
              the time from the decision to punch to the landing of the actual punch <i>is</i> slower for the chambered blow.
              This is because the chambering or backing up to the chamber position, regardless of how quickly it is done, results
              in a longer elapsed time for the blow &mdash; not to mention the telegraph you send to your opponent informing him
              that the blow is coming.  But let us set this issue aside for the moment and return to it later.

            <p>The second key to gaining velocity in punching is relaxation.  Put simply, your hand should be open and remain
              so until milliseconds before striking your target.  A&nbsp;tightly clenched fist may be strong (it works in arm
              wrestling) but, compared to a relaxed hand, it is very slow.  The relaxed hand that clenches up only
              at the instant of impact is much faster.  Beginners often use tightly clenched fists because they lack the
              necessary coordination to use a relaxed hand, but proper training should quickly overcome that.  Try it
              yourself.  Compare, for example, a traditional strong and tightly-clenched backfist blow to the head, with a
              relaxed, open-handed eye-flick.  You will quickly see that a relaxed hand is much, much faster than a clenched

              Basic <i>Hand Position</i> for a punch can be horizontal (with the palm of the hand facing down),

              In our school, when we punch we use a vertical fist 90% of the time.  The remaining 10% of the time we use
              either an uppercut or a horizontal fist.

              Some use the horizontal fist for striking down into the assailant's groin and occasionally for going over a guard
              (what many call an overhand strike).  To visualize the "overhand" strike, imagine a tight right hook delivered
              with a vertical fist.  Then rotate your arm up, so the hook is on an overhead arc (the hook has its arc on
              a horizontal plane; the overhand has the same arc but on a vertical plane).  Your once vertical-fist hook
              becomes a horizontal-fist when used "overhand."

              <p>A great advantage of the vertical punch is that it keeps your elbow down.  This gives you a much stronger
              punch because, through the entire line of the blow, your fist is aligned with your elbow, shoulder, and hip.

            <b>Horizontal punches simply do not line up that way.</b>  Moreover, combining vertical punch delivery with good
              structural body alignment (fist, elbow, and shoulder, with hip, knee, and foot &mdash; what we label as
              <i>six points of alignment</i>) results in really effective power delivery.

            <p>Beyond sound structural body alignment, the punch's power potential can be further enhanced by adding
              <i>directional harmony</i> to his blow.  ("Directional harmony" is a Parker Kenpo term describing your
              body moving in "harmony" with some other action &mdash; in this case a punch).  The directional harmony here
              is simultaneously shuffling toward your assailant, coordinated with hip rotation, and coupled with the synchronized
              extension of your fist to your target.  Proper breathing (exhaling through the blow) is also necessary but really
              outside the scope of this discussion.  (For more discussion on that element check out <i>Martial Arts America:
              A Western Approach To Eastern Arts</i>, <a href="MAA_10_metaphysical.html">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>.)

            <br>Tying all this back to our discussion about grabbing, the vertical fist shown here has the practitioner's thumb
              on top of his fist.  This means that going from open hand to closed fist happens in a single action, something
              that happens twice as fast as the natural fist's formation with its fingers rolled up followed by the thumb's reflexive
              lock-down.  Because the thumb is placed on the top of the vertical fist, Okinawan players might see it as an
              Isshin-Ryu style fist,<small><sup><a href="#fn_10">10</a></sup></small> also known as a
              sun-fist<small><sup>&thinsp;<a href="#fn_11">11</a></sup></small>.  They are correct as far as the thumb is
              concerned.  The only difference is that in this fist, the fingers are not tucked in or otherwise
              "rolled up".  Instead, the fingers are relaxed!  (Some may know this fist as a tai&nbsp;chi or pakua
              "hollow fist".)  Whether from tai&nbsp;chi or not, the term, "hollow fist" accurately captures the fist's
              structure for it is, indeed, hollow.

            <p>To visualize the hollow fist, begin with an open hand, then fold your fingers flat against your palm, as if trying
              to answer the Zen koan: "What's the sound of one hand clapping?"&nbsp;<img src="images/smiley_12_x_12_white.gif" alt="Smiley Face" width="16" height="16" border="0">&nbsp;
              The fingers lay flat against the palm, and your thumb (tucked in) rides the top of your fist.  Whether vertical,
              horizontal, or uppercut, this is the fist many well-trained fighters use for all their punching.

            <br><i>Striking point</i> is also important when punching.  Striking "point" (singular) is emphasized here
              because the blow with this fist is made primarily using the center knuckle<small>&thinsp;<sup><a href="#fn_12">12</a></sup></small>
              &mdash; the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint knuckle of the "Middle" or "Saturn" finger.
              If you must lean on another knuckle, then you use the index finger knuckle, but that is strictly secondary and not
              what you primarily want &mdash; ideally you want the center knuckle making the bulk of the contact on the target.

            <p>Some folks might ask, "Won't you break your fingers striking like that ... I mean, won't your fingers take the
              impact along with your knuckle?"  Actually, no.  What happens is that as the fingers are pressed, they
              almost flatten, and in the process, the knuckle is thrust deeper into the target.

            <a name="fn_13_back"></a>&nbsp;
            <p>To visualize this, have one of your body-builder friends stand before you, squeezing his pectoral muscles together.
              Make a variety of standard fists and punch him in the sternum.  (For this experiment you don't have to strike
              his sternum hard; you're just trying to see the kind of penetration each punch provides.)<small><sup><a href="#fn_13">13</a></sup></small>

            <p>What you will find is that when the center knuckle of the vertical fist (a right fist in this example) makes good
              contact with the sternum on even a well-muscled chest, the opponent's right pectoral muscle makes contact with your
              fingers.  Instead of causing your fist to rotate counter-clockwise (on a horizontal plane), as it would if your
              fingers were tightly rolled or tucked in, your fingers simply fold and the knuckle penetrates deeper &mdash; right
              into his sternum.  Even though we are experimenting with a very specialized blow, it illustrates well how the
              fingers are not as vulnerable as some imagine.  On top of this, the hollow fist actually does a better job of
              keeping the wrist properly aligned.  Proof of that last point is easily found by doing so-called, "knuckle"
              push-ups.

            <p>When most folks do knuckle push-ups, they form a standard vertical fist (fingers tucked in, thumb wrapped over the
              index finger), then place their fists on the deck spreading the weight over the 8 knuckles of the entire fist.
              If you do that with your elbows and forearms close enough to touch your ribs (precisely what you want in a good
              vertical punch), you'll find your wrists are bent&thinsp;!!  Instead, try the same push-up on just the one knuckle.
              Your wrist will be straight!  (Sure, your wrist may be shaking at first, but better practice and conditioning
              will resolve that <img src="images/smiley_12_x_12_white.gif" alt="Smiley face" width="16" height="16" border="0">.)

            <p>One more point before concluding this discussion: Let us look once more at the   previously mentioned hammerfist.
              Early on we said that "the natural clenched fist is suitable for striking as it works very well in a traditional
              hammerfist."  That statement remains true.  What is timely to add here is the fact that the hollow fist
              can also be used to strike as a hammerfist.  Just as traditional fists can be used to strike with knuckles
              as well as the hammerfist butt of the hand, so can the hollow fist.  This means that training to use the hollow
              fist for punching does not imply that one needs a different fist for other blows made with the fist &mdash; like the
              hammerfist.
            <p>The hollow fist is as versatile as the natural fist, but just as it takes the child more effort to
              move up from crawling to walking to running, it takes a little more time to become completely comfortable with the
              hollow fist.  That said, once you reach that level of confidence &mdash; just like the child who moves up from
              crawling to walking, you'll never want to return to crawling with that "natural" fist.

            <br><i>Punch Presentation</i> is a term that describes how punches are presented or delivered

              martial art studied (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Indonesian, etc.), in <i>most</i> martial art schools
              today punches are presented in a way that has one student (the <i>puncher</i>, the one pretending to
              be the assailant) feeding his training partner (the <i>punchee</i>, the defender) essentially a right lunge
              punch: that is, the typical straight right punch delivered from a right lead.

              This "traditional" presentation method has several problems, but a big one up front is the lunge.  The typical
              lunge punch has the puncher starting in a left lead and delivering his right punch, while stepping all the way
              through to a right lead.  From a punching perspective, that takes a long time!  Some may argue that it
              delivers the most powerful blow.  Even if that were true, if it was also effective, one would see
              it in the boxing ring.  Anyone seeing that there?  Since such a punch would break none of their
              <a href="UFC_rules.html">rules</a>, we would love to see it used effectively in mixed martial arts (MMA) matches
              &mdash; but alas, none have been used there either.

            <p>No such punches are used in boxing or MMA rings, so how about in traditional karate tournaments?
              Surely we would see them there.  Not so.  As a friend of mind living in Japan has said,
              <blockquote>
                The right lunge punch does not work in karate sparring.  All karate players know that, even if they don't
                admit it.  How do they know?  Like myself in the past, they all tried it in free sparring (usually done
                in all training) and it did not work at all.  There is simply far too much telegraphing in it for
                the other guy to miss seeing it coming.
              </blockquote>

            <p>The right lunge punch is taught religiously in traditional martial arts, but it is just as religiously ignored
              by those seeking practical and effective self-protection skills.  Though few will admit it, everyone knows it
              does not work, so no one actually uses it.  But beyond the "lunge" part of the problem, there is another issue
              here:  the fact that because the punch is a <b>straight</b> right punch, <i>the defender facing such a blow is taught
              primarily to seek a position <b>outside</b> that incoming blow</i>.  Why?  Because being outside that punch
              is simply a safer position than being inside it where one faces blows from both arms.  While the desire to get
              outside any punch for reduced risk seems reasonable, the fact is, unless you expect to fight other "traditional"
              martial-art-trained assailants, very few of the punches fired in the street are ever really
              <i>straight!</i> Talk about reality conflicting totally with training!

            <p>Despite those irrefutable facts, straight right lunge punches are still practiced in many Asian martial arts.
              Why?  Since the facts presented in this article will, by themselves, be downright offensive for many "martial
              artists" out there, we will not add more flame to the fire by providing "possible" reasons <i>why</i>
              they are taught and practiced the way they are.  However, in fairness, we must add one flame-depressant:
              <b><i>Straight right punches are actually good!</i></b> Setting aside the lunge issue and teaching students to
              try to get outside such a punch, the fact remains, a straight right punch is a very effective way to deliver a
              blow.  Everyone knows that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line &mdash; undeniable.

            <p><b><i>Compared to a haymaker, a straight punch is much quicker;</i></b> it can also be much more powerful than the haymaker
              because the punching arm is actually supported by good alignment with the puncher's body (fist and elbow aligned with the
              torso).  So while we do not see much practicality in the lunge (starting in a left lead and stepping through to
              a right lead), we definitely agree with the use of straight right punches; we even teach and practice them in a
              variety of ways.  We simply refuse to deliver or present them as the bad guy would in self-defense
              applications.  Instead, when practicing self-defense techniques, we have the puncher start in a left lead and
              fire his right punch while remaining in that lead.  The following three figures illustrate this.

              Training with your assailant in a left lead is critical because the overwhelming majority of opponents whom you
              will face, deliver their right punches from left leads.  Understand that world wide, left-handers range
              from as low as 3.4 percent of the population to as high as 27 percent.  The world-wide average is generally
              accepted to be around 13 percent.  Of&nbsp;that 13 percent, half are actually raised to be right-handers.
              That means that of those we might face in the street, 87 percent will be natural right-handers with an even greater
              93.5 percent actually facing us in a left lead!  Because of that, in our training, while we practice most of our
              hand <b><i>drills</i></b> with each player in a right lead<small>&thinsp;<sup><a href="#fn_14">14</a></sup></small>,
              when it comes to practicing self-defense techniques, we almost always have the one playing the assailant delivering
              his right cross or haymaker from a left lead.  This way the student seeking self-defense skills becomes far
              more comfortable actually getting inside the incoming blow.  And there is a bonus with this method of
              training.  Such a defense strategy actually handles all presented punches: crosses, haymakers, and even
              straight rights.

            <p>Speaking of a bonus, in the three figures that follow, you will see the assailant (on the left) in his left
              lead, facing the defender in a right, <a href="strong_side_forward.html">strong-side forward</a> lead.
              As pointed out earlier, we believe straight right punches are superior to crosses and even more circular haymakers,
              but they are even more powerful and quicker if they are fired from a right lead (something like a boxer's jab,
              but far more effective than that range gauge because the defender's punch in this example is straight, with the
              fist vertical, and maximum hip and shoulder rotation capability).  And there is a bonus above all that!
              If the defender advances, shuffling forward while delivering his right punch, he is very likely to step on his
              assailant's lead foot &mdash; something far less likely when both are in left leads!  We know.

            <p>We could go on and on about our critical components (Punching Practice, Forming the Fist, and Punch Presentation),
              but why?  The issues and arguments presented are both clear and concise.  Traditional Asian martial arts
              teachers have never provided logical answers and responses to these issues.  Never!  Oh some have provided
              illogical and weak answers, but no one on their side of the issue has ever provided an answer that both proves their
              punch presentation to be effective <b>and explains</b> why professional boxers and MMA players do not use those
              "straight right lunge punches" in their contests &mdash; much less in their own traditional karate tournaments.
              For us then, we think we can rightly say, "enough said."

            <br>Unlike the boxer, for the martial artist the punch is only one of the many weapons available for a fight.
              Still, a properly formed fist moving quickly and striking the right target with the right form behind it can make
              for one very devastating blow &mdash; a blow that can end most fights quickly.  Hopefully, you now realize
              that the forming of the fist is far and away different from the natural fist that so many try to make fit for
              punching.   Making a fist suitable for punching involves an understanding of how the human hand grasps, as much
              as knowing the best way to form this primary striking tool.  Doubtless, some will argue that training your fist
              like this is a waste of time, but do not these same individuals work just as hard to train their bare feet to strike
              using a variety of surfaces and positions (for front, side, hook, and round house kicks)?  Whether you agree or
              no, at least you have the facts and reasons.  If you disagree, don't just dismiss all this.  Come up with
              your own thoughtfully reasoned counter arguments.  If nothing else you'll be smarter for it and you may even
              punch better.

            <p>Hopefully, you have also seen how punch presentation is so absolutely drop-dead critical when it comes to
              self-defense.  No matter how you form your fist, if your training prepares you for totally unrealistic assaults,
              then you will be shocked (not to mention, smitten) by how the thug in the street struck you.  The reality is
              that what we see in our training and how we are taught to respond to that, becomes both
              <a href="reflex_and_habit_defined.html">habits and reflexes</a>.
              What we do in diligent training will be what we do in the street.  For the teachers out there, we sincerely ask,
              if you teach for self-defense, please make every effort to present the most common human blow &mdash; the punch &mdash;
              as realistically as possible.  Doing so will actually save lives.

                      More than a few <i>Modern</i> martial arts are taught differently from the way the same arts
                      were taught 100 or more years ago.  A century ago, weapons were often taught before empty hand.
                      In those days practically everyone carried a weapon of some kind and expected to use that weapon when
                      attacked by a likewise-armed assailant.  In those days empty hand training was your backup.
                      In most modern "civilized" societies, the citizenry is largely unarmed, so <i>modern</i> martial
                      art training makes empty hand instruction the primary focus, with weapons training being relegated to
                      secondary.

                      with its 3 horizontal lines and two vertical lines, resembles a vertical fist with the its three lines
                      formed by the gaps between the fingers, and the two vertical lines delimiting the sides of the fist.

                      The single knuckle striking point should <i>NEVER</i> be used to strike the bonier parts of an
                      assailant's head.  The circular shape of the human skull is designed to take (and preferably deflect)
                      blows delivered to it.  The single knuckle punch (or any punch for that matter) is really intended to
                      strike targets inferior to it &mdash; not superior.  Anyone training to successfully strike superior
                      (harder, denser) targets is training for early arthritis in the knuckles.  Serious martial arts
                      training is supposed to teach the practitioner how to hurt the other guy &mdash; not yourself!

                      We practice our hand <b><i>drills</i></b> with each player in a right lead primarily
                      because ours is a <a href="strong_side_forward.html">strong-side forward</a> [meaning "right side forward"]
                      school.  As such, from our right lead we fire very quick and highly effective straight punches from
                      our lead right hand.
