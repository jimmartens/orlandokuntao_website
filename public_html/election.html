            <br>Calvinist theology is often identified by "The Five Points of Calvinism."&nbsp; Of them, the point most
            argued and debated among believers in Christ is the one of&nbsp; <i>Unconditional Election</i>,&nbsp; a doctrine
            that asserts that God's choice from eternity of those whom He will bring to Himself is not based on foreseen
            virtue, merit, or faith in those individuals.&nbsp; Rather, it is based unconditionally on God's
            sovereignty and His grace alone.&nbsp; This, Calvinists base largely on Romans&nbsp;9:10-16.&nbsp;
            Essentially, they hold that when God chooses this individual or that (while just as arbitrarily rejecting
            others),&nbsp; <b>you&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&nbsp;have no choice</b> in accepting or rejecting God.&nbsp;
            Therefore, they say, "we have nothing in our relationship with God about which we can boast."&nbsp;
            I&nbsp;agree.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have nothing in my relationship with God about which I&nbsp;can boast,
            but&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp; for the same reasons Calvinists raise.

            <p>
            In the disquisition that follows we will look at several Scriptural points we believe show that God's
            giving man the freedom to choose or reject Him actually proves God to be more powerful and more sovereign
            than the Calvinist God who essentially chooses only automatons.

            <br>There are attributes of God we all need to consider first when examining the issues of choice and boasting.
            God is both omniscient and omnipotent.&nbsp; Even though Calvinists argue that in regards to whom God would
            choose to save (His "elect"), He still knew before the creation of the heavens and the earth, who would&nbsp;
            and would not&nbsp; accept Him through His son, Jesus.&nbsp; Such is omniscience.&nbsp; To refresh our memories,
            here are the definitions of&nbsp; <i>omniscient</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>omnipotent</i>.

                  that men claiming free will and choosing to accept God's gracious salvation have reason
                  to boast about their salvation and, therefore, do not have a genuinely humble attitude toward God and His
                  grace.&nbsp; Do those who claim that&nbsp; "<i>God chose&nbsp; THEM</i>"&nbsp; sound more humble?

                  <p>
                  Consider the thief on the cross next to Christ.&nbsp; He had&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; about which to boast, save his
                  acceptance of Christ's offer of salvation.&nbsp; But even his acceptance of that could never be
                  construed as something about which he could boast &ndash; except, perhaps, in one sense &ndash; he
                  could boast that Christ died for him.

                  <p>
                  Exercising God-given free will and accepting salvation gives one NOTHING about which to boast.
                  The gift was&nbsp; <i>offered</i>&nbsp; to ALL men, equally, and not to&nbsp; just those who accept it.&nbsp;
                  Moreover, simply accepting it in no way makes one worthy of heaven or even more noble than those who refuse it.
                  God's graciousness is greater precisely because it is offered to ALL men (1&thinsp;John&nbsp;2:2).&nbsp;
                  Whatever one's sins, it will be the refusal of&nbsp; <i>that gift</i>&nbsp; and the price Christ paid on the
                  cross, that will ultimately condemn one's soul to hell.

                  <p>
                  Freewill man, with his God-given ability to accept or reject salvation in no way reduces the
                  sovereignty of God.&nbsp; If anything, accepting God's gracious gift only comes from one who first,
                  recognizes and acknowledges that&nbsp; <b><i>he is completely and totally unworthy of the gift</i></b>,&nbsp;
                  <b>and</b>&nbsp; like every man,&nbsp; <b><i>is powerless to ever earn or merit the gift at all.</i></b>&nbsp; Any other
                  attitude toward salvation totally negates and nullifies the individual's response and acceptance since
                  any other attitude is&nbsp; <i>salvation by works</i>&nbsp; or merit,&nbsp; and not of grace.

                  clearly implies that God chooses some people over others, and while the Bible clearly states that God is
                  "no respecter of persons" (Acts&nbsp;10:34), Calvinists still have a serious problem with their doctrine because
                  of its conflict with numerous Bible passages &ndash; both Old and New Testament &ndash; that indicate&nbsp;

            Calvinists have a tough time getting around that "whosoever will."&nbsp; Tougher yet is explaining how Jesus
            takes away, not only our sins (believers' sins), but also is a propitiation (atoning sacrifice) for the whole&nbsp;
            <i><b>world</b></i>.&nbsp; Curiously, while Calvinists are unable to explain away all those "whosoever will" verses,&nbsp;
            "free will" proponents, on the other hand,&nbsp; fully accept the critical Calvinist pillar in <b>Romans&nbsp;9:11</b>.&nbsp;
            To gain the context, let us read Romans&nbsp;9, starting at verse 9 and reading through verse 12.

            With the context in mind, focus now on the critical Calvinist pillar, verse 11:
            <blockquote>
              <font color="firebrick">
                (For the children being not yet born, neither having done
                <br>any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
                <br>election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
              </font>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Why is that?&nbsp;  How is it that "free will" proponents see&nbsp; <b>no conflict</b>&nbsp; between being
            sovereignly chosen by God (the&nbsp;Calvinist position) and having free will?&nbsp; It is because they recognize
            and accept the "order" listed in Romans&nbsp;8:29-30.&nbsp; With "order" preceding everything else, a "free will"
            proponent can easily see the truth in Romans 9:11.

            <br>The apostle Paul was inspired of God to write the following in 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:40.

            That passage should be an obvious answer to the question (written the same way in some 21 translations),
            but, where possible, we should always seek other passages that affirm the Truth of God in His Word.&nbsp;
            Consider now the apostle Paul's account in 1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:15-17 of the <i>Rapture</i>.

            <p>We who are alive will NOT precede those believers in Christ who have already passed from this life.&nbsp;
            God makes that clear, repeating it twice in those three verses.&nbsp; Clearly, there is an order of events
            preceding the end times (as it says in 1&thinsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:33, our God is
            "<font color="firebrick"><b>not</b>&nbsp; the author of confusion"</font>
            <font color="Darkslategray" size="-1">[Emphasis added]</font>).&nbsp;

            <p>Look with me now at the beginning of life as we know it.&nbsp; Consider His creation of the heavens, the earth, and mankind.

            <a name="fn2_back"></a>
            <br>
            From the perspective of creation, the answer to our question,&nbsp; "Is Order Important to God?"&nbsp; should also be
            an obvious,&nbsp; "Yes,"&nbsp; for God created the heavens, the earth, and mankind in order.&nbsp; God created
            light&nbsp; <b><i>before</i></b>&nbsp; He created the sun &ndash; the generator, as it were, of our solar system's
            light&thinsp;!  He separated the land and the waters before He had the plants and animals appear therein.&nbsp;
            God's order in His creation of the heavens and the earth&nbsp; is&nbsp; obvious &ndash; read about it in
            Genesis.<small><sup>&thinsp;<a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></small>

            <p>
            Pushing our question about the importance of order still further, we must ask ourselves, is it fair to say that in
            absence of anything to the contrary in Scripture, that order is also important to God when it comes to His
            Word?&nbsp; Consider for a moment the words of the prophet Jeremiah as found in&nbsp; <b>Jeremiah&nbsp;9:23-24</b>.

            Is order important to God in what He says?&nbsp; In His Word?&nbsp; Can we, for example, switch the order of the
            words "understands" and "knows" in verse 24?&nbsp; Or can we ignore its order?&nbsp; One of the major points of
            that passage is that we can boast of&nbsp; NOTHING.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Were the order switched then some might argue that they can boast in that they know Him &ndash; at least from His
            Word.&nbsp; But the order is not "knows and understands."&nbsp; It is just the opposite &ndash; "understands and
            knows" &ndash; meaning that we really have NOTHING about which we can
            boast<small><sup>&thinsp;<a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></small>, for who of mankind, save Jesus, can rightly claim
            that they "understand" AND "know" God?

              <b>Even John Calvin's, Geneva Bible</b><small><sup>&thinsp;<a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></small> <b>says</b>,
              <br>"For whom he did&nbsp; <font color="firebrick"><b>foreknow</b></font>, &nbsp; he also did
              <font color="firebrick"><b>predestinate</b></font>"
            </center>

            &nbsp;<br>
            There are many more translations and versions available, but all the translators agree on that order &ndash;
            that foreknowledge precedes predestination, that glorification is last, and on all the others in between.&nbsp;
            Some may disagree on which English words work best here and there (foreknow, foreknew, foreknown, known
            beforehand), but the order of&nbsp; ALL&nbsp; those critical words in that verse, none deny.

            <p>
            Facing the fact that the order of the words, combined with all the scriptures clearly affirming that order&nbsp;
            is important to God,&nbsp; many then try to shift the argument away from that by saying,
            <blockquote>
              "Well, it was not God's knowing beforehand who would accept Him as their God that motivated His predestination
              and calling of them."
            </blockquote>
            Unfortunately for Calvinists, there remain four other words that are just as significant as "foreknowledge."&nbsp;
            They are the four words that immediately precede the word, "foreknow." &ndash; "<b><i>For&nbsp;whom He did</i>&nbsp;
            foreknow</b> ..."&nbsp; &nbsp; Look again at the preceding translations and versions of God's Word.&nbsp;
            Those words appear before the word for&nbsp; <i>foreknowledge</i>&nbsp; in each of them.&nbsp; "For <i>those</i>
            whom He foreknew" seems quite specific.&nbsp; In fact, even the apostle Peter in his first epistle opens with a
            statement affirming our election to be just that &ndash; <i>foreknown</i>.&nbsp; In&nbsp;

            One may argue all he wants against the importance of order to God, <sup>&nbsp;</sup>but regardless of translation,

            encapsulating word for <i>predestination</i> and <i>calling</i>.&nbsp; It preceds them here, just
            as it does in Romans, Chapter 8.

            <br>In the original language, the Greek word translated&nbsp; <i>foreknow</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>foreknew</i>&nbsp;
            is "proginosko" (prog-in-oce'-ko) which means, to know beforehand, that is, foresee, foreknow, or to know before.

            <p>
            Before God created the heavens and the earth He knew that as a completely undeserving sinner,
            I&nbsp;would nevertheless, by faith, accept Jesus, His Son, Christ as my Savior and Lord.&nbsp;
            Knowing that before it ever happened &ndash; knowing that first, God then predestined and called (elected) me.

            <p>
            It is true that God does not "foresee" men doing things in the future as we think of foreseeing
            something.&nbsp; No, God sees all things in His&nbsp; <i>unbounded now</i>.&nbsp; Regardless, it is obvious
            that WATCHING a man do something is not the same as MAKING him do it.&nbsp; Likewise, KNOWING that a man
            will accept Christ is not the same as MAKING that man do so.

            <p>
            If the lost are made to reject Christ, then one cannot condemn them for such rejection as they are
            never really able to choose to accept or reject Him.&nbsp; As such, the lost's rejection of Christ
            would actually be obedience &ndash; not something worthy of judgement and/or damnation.&nbsp;
            Such would not be justice.

            <p>
            God clearly made man with the ability to relate to and/or reject Him.&nbsp; Each of us makes that choice and
            it is precisely that choice, and only that choice, that ultimately determines one's eternal habitation.&nbsp;

            <p>More arguments can be raised and the debate continue, but it has already raged for hundreds of years
            now.&nbsp; Calvinists are so insecure in their being "chosen" that they MUST preach it again and again
            and again.&nbsp; Instead, let me conclude with this: In creating man with free will and even the ability to
            obey or disobey God (e.g. eating of "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil," Genesis&nbsp;2:17),
            as well as the ability to accept or reject Christ (e.g.  God's offer of Salvation), God
            <i>seemingly</i>&nbsp; surrendered a portion of His sovereignty to give both men and angels free
            will.&nbsp; He did this, I&nbsp;believe, because He knew that from a world of free creatures, even
            though&nbsp; <b><i>they would fall</i></b>,&nbsp; He remained powerful enough that He would still work
            out a deeper happiness,&nbsp; greater joy,&nbsp; and a fuller splendor in them,&nbsp; than&nbsp; <i>any world
            of automatons would ever admit</i>.

            &nbsp;<br>
            I&nbsp; confess, for the longest time I&nbsp;was angry with all Calvinists &ndash; and especially the
            theologians (whom I&nbsp;saw as modern-day Sadducees &ndash; they do not know God's love which is why
            they are so <i>"sad,&nbsp;you&nbsp;see"</i>&nbsp;<img src="images/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" align="bottom" width="15" height="15" border="0">).&nbsp;
            &nbsp; But without even addressing the schism, the division in the church Calvinistic doctrine caused (violating
            1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10-11 and 12:25), I&nbsp;felt that because of insecurity in their own salvation
            (were they <i>reeeeally</i>&nbsp; chosen?), they pounded Calvinism upon their congregations in the hope that if
            they could convince everyone that they were right, then perhaps they really&nbsp; <i>might</i>&nbsp; be right.&nbsp;
            That way they might feel more secure in their own faith.&nbsp; Thankfully, my anger against them has abated, and
            I&nbsp;have learned to pray for them.

                  to the convicted, but is such an act shown out of love? &nbsp; For all of God's sovereignty, His omniscience

                      &nbsp;

                        <i>
                          Since the arrangement of all things is in the hand of God, since to him belongs the
                          disposal of life and death,  he arranges all things by his sovereign counsel,  in such
                          a way that individuals are are born, who are doomed from the womb to certain death,
                          and are to glorify him by their destruction.  ...   I, for my part,  am willing to admit,
                          that mere prescience [foreknowledge] lays no necessity on the creatures ... the
                          dispute is superfluous since life and death are acts of the divine will rather than of
                          prescience.  If God merely foresaw human events, and did not also arrange and
                          dispose of them at his pleasure, there might be room for agitating the question,
                          how far his foreknowledge amounts to necessity; but since he foresees the things
                          which are to happen, simply because he has decreed that they are so to happen,
                          it is vain to debate about prescience, while it is clear that all events take place
                          by his sovereign appointment.

                      Calvinists argue constantly that being sovereignly chosen by God gives them absolutely no
                      reason to boast.&nbsp; They seem haunted by the possibility of "boasting" precisely because
                      being chosen by the God who created the universe inherently implies one <i>might</i> be able to
                      boast about <i>being chosen by God</i>.&nbsp; Speaking as one who has gladly chosen to accept
                      God's offer of salvation through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, let me make it clear:
                      I&nbsp;have nothing for which to brag about my choice.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am just so grateful that God offered
                      me His salvation.&nbsp; I&nbsp;did not deserve it, I&nbsp; could not earn it, nor can I&nbsp;be even good
                      enough to keep it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have NOTHING about which I&nbsp;can boast!

                      themselves to us by their own free choice means everything.&nbsp; Such is precisely the kind of
                      love God desires from us.
