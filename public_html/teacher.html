            <br>The traditions found in Western boxing and wrestling (at least in the professional ranks) are negative,
            rather than positive.  These "arts" do not build character, they destroy it.  With this experience
            so close to home, it is the irresponsible instructor who leaves character building to chance.
            We cannot excuse ourselves with "I only taught my student how to hurt someone.  What he does with the
            skills that I gave him is not my concern."  A trainer might say that, but never a teacher.

            <p>Martial art instructors must be more than just trainers and coaches; we must be teachers and
            educators.  Without spending a lot of time indoctrinating our students in another cultural life-style,
            culturally American instructors are obligated to give their students what the majority of them are asking
            for (and paying for): good martial art skills.  But we must also equip them with the skills necessary
            for developing their powers of reason and judgment, skills that prepare them for life as mature martial
            artists and contributing members of society.<small><sup>&nbsp;1</sup></small>

                Since the writing of <i>Martial Arts America</i>, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has become very
                popular.  Unfortunately, like professional wrestling, MMA trainers are much, much more
                successful at producing <i>characters</i> in their instruction, than they are in any development
                of <i>character</i> among their trainees.
