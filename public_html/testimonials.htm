He is similar to our Guro:  very open, honest, non-political, gracious, humble, lighthearted and fun.&nbsp; It is rare to find an instructor who doesn't hold back and believes that any sincere question deserves a sincere answer.<p>He is also constantly trying to find ways to teach better and maximize training time.&nbsp; For that reason, he had a senior student assist in teaching on Days 1 and 2, allowed us to train in his open classes, and asked us to preview his new videotape for release in October, "Fighting Drills for Fighting Skills," to gain our feedback.&nbsp; The Kilap Hand Sets we covered in Day 3 is a subset of this 2 tape set and is shot extremely well from multiple angles and with narration during the action.<p>In short, we had a great time and was graced by Bob's personality, ability, knowledge and teaching ability.&nbsp; We would recommend him to anyone at any level seeking to learn Indonesian Martial Arts.<p>Jason Brigham, Raphael Chiu, Ben Lum<p>Students of Maha Guro Nathan Defensor <br>Defensor Method of FMA-IMA<p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center" noshade>

This workshop was incredible.&nbsp; Bob's skills in Silat and Kuntao are amazing and even more impressive are the skills Bob has in teaching his art.&nbsp; Bob is passionate about teaching, and passes this on to all the participants.&nbsp; In a matter of minutes after picking him up at the airport we felt as though we had made a new friend and by the end of the weekend we had! Bob makes all of the participants feel at ease in the dojo with him.&nbsp; This workshop was a lot of fun and a lot of good hard work.&nbsp; Everyone sweats!  (Including Bob!)&nbsp; There is no attitude with Bob like some other big name martial artists.&nbsp; As soon as Bob began the workshop the excitement started.&nbsp; He welcomes any and all questions and gives handouts for each topic covered at the workshop.&nbsp; This way you have something to look back on as a training aid.<p>If you are not familiar with Bob Orlando, I suggest looking into his books and videos and definitely consider him for a workshop in your area.&nbsp; You will get more than your moneys worth!<p>(Here is a hint.....Be the host!  You get to pick his brain all weekend long.!)<p>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.<p>Doug Petrarca<br>Thibault School of Reality Fighting<br>Providence, RI<br>ddpp11@yahoo.com<p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center" noshade>
