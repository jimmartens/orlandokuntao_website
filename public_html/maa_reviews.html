              <p>
              Martial Arts America is an easy read for a book that tackles the level of controversy Orlando seems attracted to like
              a prison parolee in a JC Penny's women's underwear section.&nbsp; Still, although he pulls no punches, Bob is never
              in-your-face blunt, and usually softens his hard-hitting points with alternative views and the occasional "perhaps".&nbsp;
              To the average martial arts instructor, most of Orlando's material comes across as heretical or insulting, but that's
              only because he addresses many of the points that the conventional martial arts teacher believes are either taboo or
              simply not to be discussed.&nbsp; ...
              <p>I have seen many posts denigrating his thoughtful and intelligently phrased questions, or dismissively waving them
              aside as if such thoughts weren't worthy of the dignity of a retort.&nbsp; Write that one down as "Mistake #1", because
              the intelligent practitioner of today, armed with youtube, websites and podcasts is far more informed and inquisitive
              than in the 1980's.&nbsp; You can no longer tell your students "When in doubt, fake it", and get away with it, a
              dues-paying adult with a full time job and a family to support won't stand for such nonsense.

              <p><b>Very Thought Provoking Look At The Martial Arts From A Westerners Eyes</b>
              <br>I found this to be a very interesting book in its approach as it takes a very practical and realistic
              look at traditional martial arts attitudes, philosophies, and practices as seen and analyzed from a western
              perspective.&nbsp; When I read this book <i>I didn't see it as debasing the traditional Eastern approach to

              so very much.<p>Now although I don't necessarily agree with chapter and verse what the author says, <i>I did
              thoroughly enjoy this book and would highly recommend it to every martial artist regardless of style</i>

              <p><b>Good Book For Newbies</b>
              <br>I picked this up at used bookstore for $5 for a quick read.&nbsp; I've been in martial arts for over
              30 years, spent about 5 years as an amateur boxer in my teens and have since kickboxed, and studied shotokan
              and japanese ju jitsu.&nbsp; Although the book is entertaining and well written, I can't say there was much
              new information in here for anyone who has been practicing since the Bruce Lee revolution.&nbsp;
              Mr.&nbsp;Orlando addresses topics such as classical versus Western, practical/traditional, chi, kata,
              street clothes versus gi, barefoot/sneakers, sport karate/self defense, finding a dojo and style, etc.&nbsp;
              The advice is all good, and whether you agree or not with his conclusions, if you've never trained and are
              confused by all the options and styles, it is good food for thought and a good introduction to the modern
              state of training. ... The martial arts is a big ocean, and there's room for everybody, which I think is
              Orlando's point.&nbsp; He does a good job of pointing out the differences, similarities, pros and cons,
              and potential ripoffs and pitfalls.&nbsp; <i>I would recommend this book to anyone thinking of starting

              <p><b>Very Disappointing</b>
              <br>While this book makes some interesting points it comes across more as an anti-tradition propaganda
              piece than a useful treatise on martial arts.&nbsp; My problem with that approach is that while boxing,
              wrestling, and other sports are currently associated with name-calling, ear biting, tattooed freaks,
              Asian martial arts have managed to maintain much of their dignity, ostensibly through an adherence to

              <p>Bob Orlando debunks myths, skewers traditions, and applies an objective viewpoint to "the way it's
              always been done."&nbsp; The topics in this book are those you'll consider as you mature as a martial
              artist.&nbsp; This book covers many of the fundamental issues surrounding studying ancient fighting arts
              in the modern world.&nbsp; How should the martial arts adapt to a modern, polycultural world?&nbsp;
              Orlando tells it like it is.<br>&nbsp;

              <p>Bob Orlando's book Martial Arts America is about how Eastern martial arts are adapted or should be
              adapted in the West and more specifically the US.&nbsp; This book has many good examples and suggestions
              for adapting Eastern martial arts.&nbsp; For example Orlando talks about how modern safety equipment
              changed the way most people train today as compared with how training was conducted in the past.&nbsp;
              Orlando also talks about where some of the traditions of the martial arts came from and why they are
              what they are.&nbsp; He also talks about why some of them should be changed.&nbsp; I don't agree with
              everything Orlando says but I agree with the underlying arguement of the book that Eastern martial arts
              must be adapted to the culture that they are transported too.&nbsp; This book is thought provoking and
              should be read by students and instructors alike.<br>&nbsp;

              <br><b>Book Review By John Himes</b>
              <p><i>Martial Arts America: A Western Approach To Eastern Arts</i>, By Bob Orlando.&nbsp;
              Orlando is a Christian martial artist based in Colorado with long experience in Pentjak Silat,
              an Indonesian art, and Chinese Kuntao.&nbsp; He is also a very thoughtful writer.&nbsp; This book
              should cause you to rethink your approach to teaching the martial arts as a Christian in America.&nbsp;
              Orlando has produced a thought-compelling book that proves you can successfully teach traditional
              martial arts from a Western, Christian perspective.

              <p>The idea [of this book] is not to jam the author's opinion down your throat or any other form of
              indoctrination.&nbsp; Mr. Orlando uses logic and sound reasoning to explain his points of view, but
              his ultimate goal is to get your mind in gear and think. Then think some more.
              <p>Whether you agree with him or not is completely irrelevant.&nbsp; The fact that you reconsider
              your original opinion and perhaps gain a greater understanding of your art, is.&nbsp; <b><i>Before
              you think the author spends his ink bashing on traditional styles, this isn't the case</i></b>
              [emphasis added].&nbsp; He seems to make an effort to find something positive and valuable in each
              case.&nbsp; Sometimes this is possible, other times not.<p>If you are new to the arts and sometimes
              feel a nagging doubt that what your teacher does/says, might not be the best thing for your martial
              study, read this book.&nbsp; You might just conclude you were right .. or not.&nbsp; If you have been
              studying for a long time, read it too.&nbsp; There just might be some things in the book that make
              you think again about topics you formed an opinion on a long time ago.&nbsp;At any rate, I highly
              recommend this book.

              <p><b>East Meets West</b>
              <br>This book, cleverly written by Bob Orlando, is an enjoyable read.&nbsp; The book is humorous at
              times because of his witty style, yet always serious and shedding light on this topic of martial arts.

              <p><b>This Book was Just What I Needed</b>
              <br>Great job. I learned a lot from the book, and it was good to receive both confirmation and
              development on things I was thinking about, myself.  I also harbor a dream of becoming a part
              time instructor, myself, and your book contained lots of useful things to think about concerning
              how I would want to structure my own martial arts school if that ever becomes a reality.

              <p><b>Pros:</b>Sensible look at martial arts and where they can/should be going.
              <p><b>Cons:</b>More people haven't read it!
              <br>What first caught my attention about Bob Orlando's "Martial Arts America" was the fact that the book
              was dedicated to Ed Parker, the founder of American Kenpo Karate &ndash; a martial arts system I've been studying
              for several years.&nbsp; American Kenpo is all about examining the martial arts and identifying the parts
              that make sense in today's environment.&nbsp; I'm a big fan of Ed Parker's system and his philosophy about
              the martial arts, so I figured any book dedicated to him couldn't be half bad.

              <p>Martial Arts America is filled throughout with examples, illustrations, and some great cartoons that
              light-heartedly point out some of the flaws in martial arts philosophy and practice. ... a very good book
              for anyone with interest in the martial arts, from beginner on up to the highest ranks!

              <p>I really enjoyed this book. Matter of fact, one of the things I appreciated the most about it was in the
              beginning, when he said this book is for people who practice martial arts primarily for self-defense &ndash; and
              that if you don't, this book either won't make sense, or won't relate to you at all. That kind of refreshing
              honesty and bluntness characterizes this book, which is a good thought-provoking commentary on modern teaching
              of martial arts. Worth reading, in my opinion.<br>&nbsp;

              <p>
              Martial Arts America is a thought-provoking examination of Eastern martial art traditions and their evolution to
              modern Western practice.&nbsp; In it, martial arts instructor and author Bob Orlando challenges the effectiveness of
              many Eastern martial art practices and training methods for modern Western culture.&nbsp; Traditions like the use of
              foreign language, the practice of bowing, and the necessity of spiritual training are examined in light of their
              meaning in contemporary American culture.&nbsp; By focusing on the most effective and relevant way for Americans to
              pursue the various martial arts, Orlando's practical insights penetrate a subject that has been too often shrouded
              in mysticism and marketing hype.&nbsp; <i>Martial Arts America</i>&nbsp; is enhanced for the reader with 30 photos
              and 79 illustrations.&nbsp; Also highly recommended is Orlando's&nbsp; <i>Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals</i>&nbsp;
              and its companion video,&nbsp; <i>Fighting Arts Of Indonesia: Combat Secrets Of Silat And Kuntao</i>.
