            <p>There are more ways to attack with the feet than kicking.&nbsp; Many commercialized martial arts have
              lost a wide array of offensive foot and legwork that was initially in the systems.&nbsp; And most defensive
              tactics have never even heard of the idea.&nbsp; This video will help you plug-in this incredibly effective
              tool ... whatever style you study.<br>&nbsp;
          <!-- 20011105
            <p>It's unfortunate, but when you talk about footwork in a combative sense what people think you're
              talking about is the modified martial sport version.&nbsp; A version that while it does strongly
              relate to punching and kicking, lacks the devastating offensive capabilities of combative
              footwork.&nbsp; Did you know that you can attack with your feet and legs without throwing kicks?&nbsp;
              And that these attacks not only render your opponent vulnerable, unable to defend himself, but
              most important, incapable of counter attacking!&nbsp; And you can achieve this by simply putting
              your leg/foot into an inconvenient position for him.&nbsp; Not only are these DVDs of invaluable
              help to law enforcement and correctional officers for quickly and safely ending a violent encounter,
              but for martial artists as well.&nbsp; This sort of offensive legwork was in many styles BEFORE
              it was stripped out to make them martial sports rather than an effective fighting systems.&nbsp;
              Once you've reviewed these DVDs you will be able to recognize within your own system the fighting
              footwork potential.

            <p><b>Excellent</b>
            <p>This is a fine set covering the footwork skills of Silat.&nbsp; My understanding is that it comes from the
              kuntao influenced side of Silat.&nbsp; Many different footwork drills are shown along with their practical
              applications.&nbsp; Also noteworthy is that several lankahs (basically long forms or katas) are included,
              which are hard to find on video; at least I haven't seen them documented before and I've seen a fair number
              of Silat videos over the years so I was very pleased to have that information.&nbsp; Guru Orlando's discussion
              is very clear and well done and I think he is a good teacher.&nbsp; His approach is very systematic and in
              depth and not piecemeal, taking you from the basic to the more advanced techniques.&nbsp; Whether you're a
              beginner or a more advanced practitioner you'll probably find something of value here.&nbsp; Overall this is
              a fine series which offers a lot of material and value for your money.<br>&nbsp;

            <p>This DVD set is a great complement to the other DVDs recorded by Bob Orlando and for that matter a great tool
              that could enhance your current training regardless of the system you currently practice.&nbsp; I&nbsp;always
              pay attention to skills or techniques that can help me respond at a moments notice particularly as I&nbsp;get
              older.&nbsp; Skills like the ones you find in these DVDs will help use enough force minimizing body mechanics
              and strength, in addition to increasing coordination and balance.&nbsp; These are all factors you start noticing
              to diminish with age.&nbsp; I'm 50 years old and have been training for some time in Ju-Jutsu and I'm always
              evaluating and studying ways to improve as I&nbsp;age.<br>&nbsp;

            <p><b>Dont forget this</b>
            <p>Many find footwork drills boring, however you will quickly see here how this footwork can be
              applied to your skills.&nbsp; Many hate doing drills that don't involve kicking someone's tail,
              however, if your studying Silat with the goal of being a complete fighter, this is required
              material.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will say that Bob makes these drills interesting because he'll do a drill,
              then apply it to your everyday scenario.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will say that after seeing this video, it

            <br>
              There are hundreds of videos on Silat and Kuntao out there, with more coming out every month.&nbsp;
              It's easy to spend a lot of money on something that wasn't worth the box it came in.&nbsp; However,
              if you are looking for some serious insight into the Indonesian martial arts, Bob&nbsp;Orlando's
              "Fighting Footwork of Kuntao and Silat" and "Fighting Forms of Kuntao-Silat" are the perfect place to start.

 <!--  4 --><p><b>From www.malayarts.net:&nbsp; Forum</b>
            <br>March 1, 2007<p>I just had the chance to watch all four of the footwork videos by
              Bob&nbsp;Orlando.&nbsp; I can recommend them 100% to any and all who are looking to gain more
              insight into the fighting footwork of Kuntao-Silat ... Bob&nbsp;Orlando breaks down these footwork
              drills to finest detail, and the use of graphics will help you get an understanding that you may
              not have had before.&nbsp; Bob&nbsp;Orlando also shows you how to apply this video into your
              present system to enhance your techniques.<p>I liked the points that Bob&nbsp;Orlando brought out
              like, train as you fight.&nbsp; In a high stress situation you will resort back to your training,
              so you want your training to be as real as possible.&nbsp; I&nbsp;very rarely hear of this coming
              from an instructor.<p>On a scale form 1 to 10, I&nbsp;would give Bob&nbsp;Orlando's use of comedy
              in this video a 3.<img src="images/face_smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face">&nbsp; However, on the same scale,
              I&nbsp;will give this video an 11 for the great information about Kuntao-Silat.&nbsp; Do yourself
              a favor, if your going to spend money on a video series, I would highly recommend this one.

            <p>I'm a big fan of silat, and generally of anything from Bob Orlando.&nbsp; It should be no surprise
              that I give a positive review of this Paladin Press DVD.&nbsp; Note, that I am reviewing DVD
              1&nbsp;of a 4 DVD set.&nbsp; As you might expect from the title, this DVD focuses on the footwork
              (lankahs) of Orlando's Dutch-Indonesian silat.&nbsp; His explanations and demonstrations are clear,
              systematic, and well thought-out.&nbsp; Orlando wisely explains in the beginning of the video not
              to get hung up on techniques.&nbsp; The intent is to develop skills through exercise and
              observation.&nbsp; He then goes on to demonstrate the lankahs, and their application in concert
              with upper-body exercises.&nbsp; The production is excellent with obvious attention paid to clear
              sound and video.&nbsp; The information and exercises would be useful for most martial artists.&nbsp;
              This video may not be as useful for beginners as it would be for skilled martial artists.&nbsp;
              Although Orlando breaks down the concepts and principles well, it's clear this DVD is an extension
              of his earlier works on silat.&nbsp; <i>If your looking to add some great footwork drills to your
              martial arts training, look no further.&nbsp; I also appreciate understanding why the drills are
              important, and Orlando delivers</i> [emphasis added].<br>&nbsp;

            <p>If like me, you only have limited brain power, chances are you'll feel overwhelmed after viewing
              this DVD for the first time.&nbsp; It is so crammed with information, you just cannot process
              everything right away.&nbsp; Bob gives you tons of material&nbsp;
              <font face="Verdana,Arial">...</font>&nbsp; meaning not only techniques and drills but also
              concepts and strategies to apply in all of your game.&nbsp; Wonderful as this is for us, it makes
              reviewing the disc a bit difficult.&nbsp; It is hard to do it justice without making a checklist
              of everything that's in it.&nbsp; And there's a lot.&nbsp; I've said it before, Mr.&nbsp;Orlando
              goes into detail about things that are the "secret teachings" of other styles.&nbsp; He is
              extremely generous in providing information.&nbsp; <font face="Verdana,Arial">...</font>&nbsp;
              In this DVD, you will find hours and hours of training material plus the possibility to verify
              almost any of the questions your study might bring forward.
            <p>If you are training in Southeast   Asian martial arts, you will love this disc for the drills it
